Title: Scaling a High School Football Podcast Service

Topics: Growth Strategy, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
Launching in fall 2020 with a pilot program of 16 schools, 16 sponsors, and four broadcasters, PostGame Recap plans to grow 10x by Spring 2023 and 30x by Fall 2023. To achieve that, we would like to ask you to propose a plan for growth in three key areas: high school football teams, sponsors, and student broadcasters or social media interns.
PostGame Recap makes weekly podcasts with each team, giving insider information about the players, the preparation, and the upcoming games. The podcasts are free for all high schools but need more sponsors to expand and develop.

### Key Action Items:
We want to hear your proposal and ideas on how to find new sponsors that are good fits for the company. You should consider the following areas: a.; who are PostGame Recapâ€™s listeners? Thus who would be the ideal sponsors? b., What products or services would integrate well into our podcasts? c., What kind of products/services does our audience want to hear/learn about? And finally, what does research in industry publications, social media, and other communications suggest about who PostGame Recap should target?
