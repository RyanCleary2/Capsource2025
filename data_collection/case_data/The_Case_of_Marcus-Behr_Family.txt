### Background and Objective:
Samuel Marcus is a 37-year-old white male. He is married to Matthew Marcus-Behr. They have been in a committed relationship for the last 17 years and officially married seven years ago when Gay marriage became legal in the United States (U.S.). Sam has a high-paying position as an executive at a major corporation. Matt is a freelance artist who works from home. Although he is well-known and respected in his field, Marcus has yet to land a major private commission or gallery installment. He is hopeful about the latest project he is working on.Sam and Matt have two children. Jackson, 13, is their eldest.  They became foster parents to Jackson when he was three years old. After several years in the foster care system, Jackson’s biological parents, Chris and Jennifer, had their rights to Jackson terminated due to neglect and substance abuse violations. Sam and Matt marry and adopt Jackson, who is 6 at the time, shortly thereafter. Recently, Jackson has had difficulty at school primarily for not turning in his homework and last week he was caught smoking a cigarette.Max, their second child is two years old. They adopted him at birth through open adoption. Max’s biological mother, Monica, is welcome into the family’s home and has visitation at designated times. There is no relationship with the biological father. Recently Max has become aggressive while at daycare causing the family to be referred to a social worker (SW) for family counseling.

### Key Action Items:
Max is a 2 years old male who is in daycare part-time. Both of his adoptive parents work although his dad Matt’s schedule is more flexible hence why Max attends part-time. Max has contact with his biological mother, Monica, during agreed-upon dates and times and she is welcomed into the Marcus/Behn home by both of Max’s adoptive parents. Max does not know his biological father as his father did not wish to be involved in Max's life. Max follows his older brother, Jackson, who is also adopted, but has different birth parents, around the house all the time. Jackson thinks Max is a ‘wild man’, but loves his little brother.
Recently, Sam and Matt were called to the daycare for a conference with the Director of Little Lights daycare, Jessie, as well as, Max’s group daycare worker, Claire. Jessie informed Sam and Matt that Claire had observed Max biting one of the other toddlers in his group. Jessie also shared that several of the other parents had heard about Max’s biting incident. It was important for the other parents to have the daycare identify if this was an isolated incident or if Max displayed other aggressive behavior. Multiple parents had expressed concern that Max would bite their children too.
In addition to the parents, several of Little Lights’ employees expressed concern about Max noting that they thought he may have an overall aggressive personality. Some workers even went as far as to imply Max may have "some condition" from his biological parents that caused him to be "aggressive." They continued their comments stating that they believed that because Max was not seeing his Mother regularly this acerbated his angry behavior. They were referred to a social worker for family counseling to help Max with his aggression.  When Sam and Matt meet with the social worker (SW) they share that they have an older son, Jackson, who is a 13-year-old middle schooler. They share that he is also adopted, but that he has no contact with his biological parents who are in prison for child abuse and other crimes. This school year, Jackson recently began having trouble due to not turning in all his homework; last week he was caught smoking a cigarette with a friend behind the school. He has always been a quiet child and has never been in trouble before. To complicate matters, Sam and Matt do not agree on the correct approach to parenting. As Jackson has gotten older and Max has been adopted,  they find themselves constantly arguing about several childrearing topics. Matthew is extremely concerned that Jackson was caught smoking. He is not necessarily worried that Jackson "got in trouble”,  but more about the health implications associated with smoking cigarettes, e.g. habit forming, different types of cancer, etc. Sam does not condone smoking,  but he does not see it as "a big deal" for Jackson to try it. He sees it more as a typical ‘right of passage’. Sam and Jackson often joke that Matthew is a health nut’ who worries too much. On the other hand,  Sam is worried that something "might be wrong “with Max due to his biting. Matt does not agree. Based on the research that Matt has done, he feels that it is normal behavior for a two-year-old.
In addition, Matt believes that the daycare may be at the heart of the issue with Max. He feels that workers have stigmatized him or may have possible unconscious biases against Max because he is adopted. He also feels that the daycare’s comments about the lack of bonding with Max’s mother, Monica, are deeply problematic because it creates a false narrative that Monica is not in Max’s life. Last, but not least Matt does wonder if ‘under the surface’ the daycare itself is not supportive of LGBTQ+ adoption, which leads them to automatically believe a child should be with their biological mother.
Scenario 1:
The social worker requests a report from the daycare outlining their concerns, Max’s behavior, and other pertinent information. Upon reviewing the files, speaking to other parties involved, and meeting with the Marcus/Behr family several times the SW is concerned that the daycare has a high level of bias toward the family directly related to the LGBTQ+ community.
Scenario 2:
While the family is engaged in counseling, Jackson begins skipping school, smoking cigarettes on a regular basis, and taking money out of the savings jar at home. Sam continues to joke about it with Jackson, but Matt is increasingly alarmed. When Matt confronts Jackson one day after school the argument quickly escalates with Jackson throwing a dish at Matt’s head. He then takes off and it is several hours before his parents are able to locate him.
Scenario 3:
Matt and Sam are at a loss for what to do in terms of their relationship and their very different approach to parenting. They argue all the time about parenting and they have difficulty even being in the same room. Sam decides to temporarily move out of the family home causing further turmoil for the children. Jackson begins to wonder; if his parents break up will he be placed once again in the foster care system? Max wanders around the house constantly crying and looking for Sam.
