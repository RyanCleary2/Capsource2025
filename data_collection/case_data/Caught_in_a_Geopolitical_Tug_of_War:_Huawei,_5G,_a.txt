Title: Caught in a Geopolitical Tug of War: Huawei, 5G, and the European Union

Topics: Legal, Regulatory, Compliance

### Background and Objective:
The "fifth generation" (5G) of telecommunication systems will be one of the most critical building blocks of the European Union (EU) digital economy and society in the next decade. The EU has taken significant steps to lead global developments towards this strategic technology. 5G will provide virtually ubiquitous, ultra-high bandwidth, and low latency connectivity not only to individual users, but also to connected objects.1 From artificial intelligence to self-driving cars to telemedicine, all the things Europeans hope will make their lives easier, safer, and healthier will require high-speed, always-on internet connections. However, China-based Huawei Technologies Co., the world’s largest provider of telecom equipment maker and leader of 5G technology, has faced opposition in the EU over building out the new 5G infrastructure on the continent. Amid security concerns, the EU has raised fears that Huawei’s equipment could be used to spy on countries and companies at the behest of the Chinese government. The case involves multiple stakeholders and raises economic, legal, and ethical issues worthy of consideration.
Huawei’s technology touches virtually every corner of the globe. Huawei’s carrier business (e.g., networking equipment) has been the company’s heart and soul, but its enterprise business (e.g., cloud computing) has grown at breakneck speed. Huawei got its start supplying telecom equipment to rural areas of China, which remains its largest market. Huawei later expanded to other developing markets before capturing a significant share of Europe’s telecom market. Currently, Huawei along with Chinese peer ZTE, hold a combined market share in the EU of more than 40%.2 Huawei is well entrenched in existing 4G wireless networks on the continent. Huawei’s equipment is priced so cheaply and is of such high quality that EU mobile operators have little choice but to use it. If the EU were to institute a ban on Huawei due to security threats emanating from its products, replacing existing networks would be expensive. For EU countries that have Huawei 4G gear, it makes sense to have their 5G gear as well, as there are financial incentives that can’t be overlooked. Neither operators nor the governments of the EU have the funding to replace Huawei in their networks.3 According to an industry analysis, restricting Huawei from EU networks would cost the region $62 billion, delay 5G rollout for 18 months, and reduce competition in the network equipment market. The analysis assumed that there was no security risk to using Huawei equipment.4
Two wide-ranging Chinese national security laws are of grave concern to governments worldwide: the National Intelligence Law and the Counter-Espionage Law. The former requires Chinese information technology (IT) firms to support, assist, and cooperate in national intelligence work. The latter states that during the course of a counter-espionage investigation, relevant organizations and individuals, must truthfully provide information and must not refuse. Major governments including Japan, Australia, and the United States have blocked Huawei from providing hardware for 5G. The United States has argued that Huawei equipment could provide backdoors to the Chinese government into American networks.5 The EU identified a series of specific security threats posed by foreign vendors of telecommunications equipment, significantly heightening the bloc’s scrutiny of suppliers like Huawei. EU leaders will lay out specific guidelines for member states on how best to approach issues of security within 5G networks which EU member countries, can choose to adopt or ignore.6The confrontation between the United States and China over Huawei’s role in the deployment of 5G networks in Europe has placed the EU in the middle of a geopolitical tug of war and has led to questions about the EU’s approach to the issue and ultimately which side the EU will take on the matter.7 The United States has cautioned the EU that allowing untrustworthy companies such as Huawei to supply networking equipment could jeopardize the sharing of sensitive information between nations. The United States has also warned the EU that Huawei could steal intellectual property, engage in espionage, and potentially sabotage networks. Huawei has vehemently denied any criminal wrongdoing and has taken exception to being unfairly maligned by the United States. Huawei has countered that the United States has not provided evidence that it has worked inappropriately with the Chinese government or that it would in the future. Huawei has insisted that it will remain independent of the Chinese government despite its national security laws. Moreover, Huawei has contended that there are ways to manage and mitigate risks which have worked successfully in other countries.8

### Key Action Items:
Firstly research the company and understand its background in the EU. Deep dive into the security concerns and regulatory challenges. Examine the company’s impact on the European market and try to predict its future in the region. After answering the guiding questions below, prepare a presentation and summarize your findings and thoughts on the complexity of this case.
