### Key Action Items:
Main/Current:
Hunter James, age 36, recently visited his primary care physician on the urging of his wife, Roberta. She is concerned about Hunter’s behavior in relation to their family which includes two boys, Gunner and Donald. Roberta is troubled about Hunter’s recent withdrawal from family outings and activities - even those involving the church, which they have always been active in. Roberta has also noticed that Hunter has been more irritable and less patient with their two children, Gunner and Donald. After speaking with the church leader about his withdrawal from his responsibilities within the church and his family Hunter agrees to an evaluation from his PCP.
Based on the results from the mood and depression screening, Hunter’s physician recommends Hunter begins meeting with a social worker (SW) associated with the PCP’s office. Hunter is already skeptical about his PCP’s capabilities to help him given his family's belief that the medical system failed both his brother and his mother. Hunter is reluctant to follow the PCP’s recommendation, but he is hoping that the SW will realize that he is physically ill and does not suffer from any issues associated with his mental health.
At his first visit with Anne, the social worker, Hunter shares his reluctance and acknowledges the awkwardness of talking to a stranger. When Anne asks him to expand on this, Hunter states that it is due to the fact that he is uncomfortable discussing his feelings with anyone, especially “strangers.”   He explains that growing up, he was taught to “be a man and never cry or show emotions.” She then listens as he shares his thoughts on needing medical assistance for physical ailments, not mental health support.
With Roberta’s coaxing, Hunter returns for a second session. He states that he is having a hard time opening up to Anne and developing rapport. He states it seems unnatural to talk about his problems especially to someone outside of his family/church. Hunter continues to reiterate how much physical pain he’s having.  Although it is early in their sessions together, Anne suspects Hunter’s symptoms are a physical manifestation of his depression.
Precipitating events:
Hunter returns from college expecting to find a paid position within a congregation based on references and his degree. He quickly realizes that those positions are few and far between in rural communities. His new wife, Roberta, suggests that they consider moving so that he can utilize his degree and work in the field he is passionate about. Believing that this is the best decision, he shares the news with his extended family and the church. Neither are supportive of the idea. His father states he is deeply disappointed that Hunter would even consider leaving
his family
especially after all the sacrifices they made. The church leader echos these sentiments in front of the entire congregation. He then publicly cautions Hunter against being led by greed and selfishness and giving his wife too much decision making power in the family structure. The church offers Hunter a formal, unpaid position within the church with promises of a future hired position
once the church is able
.
Hunter decides that he is obligated to stick it out. Roberta does not agree, but soon after she discovers she is pregnant. They both realize that they need to do something quickly in order to provide for their future newborn, Gunner. Hunter obtains a management position at the local grocery store and works every Saturday at his father’s farm. Both Hunter and Roberta believe it is only temporary until Hunter is hired by the church. Unfortunately, over the next few years that position does not materialize. In addition, even though they used protection, they soon found themselves welcoming a second son, Donald. As both Hunter and Roberta see their career dreams change into real time realities of life, Roberta becomes a full time, stay at home mom. Hunter becomes a branch manager overseeing three local grocery stores within the company's chain. Neither Hunter nor Roberta is  satisfied with their current status, but they love their boys and are deeply committed to each other. They focus on being good parents, spending time together as a family, and making the best of their current situation.
Eventually, the boys are old enough to enter public school. Once Donald is in kindergarten, Roberta decides to take a few graduate classes. Once again the church and Hunter’s family express their dismay. Hunter, unable to openly discuss his thoughts and feelings, begins coming home later and later every night, sometimes barely seeing the boys or talking to Roberta.
Then last year, the church announced that they were able to offer a new paid, full time position. Interested parties were required to interview, but the church pastor assured Hunter he would be given the job. When the search and interview process was completed, the church elected to bring in an individual who was “more aligned with the congregation's core values on family and the community.” Hunter was devastated. He soon began experiencing physical ailments. Feeling alienated from the church, he listened to Roberta’s urging to see their PCP.
Scenario 1:
After speaking with his church leader, Hunter refuses to access services and his mental health continues to deteriorate. Roberta, concerned about the increase in Hunter’s anger and lashing out toward the children, decides to leave until Hunter chooses to address his mental health issues with a trained professional.
Scenario 2:
Hunter continues to meet with his SW, Anne. Due to the fact that it is early in treatment and is unpacking decades of trauma, his irritability continues to increase along with his lack of patience. This begins impacting his work, but he remains unwilling to disclose his MH issues to his employer. Hunter is fired from his job terminating his health insurance and jeopardizing his ability to meet with Anne.
Scenario 3:
After multiple sessions, Hunter feels empowered to confront past trauma and to address future possibilities outside of his hometown and the church. He gets a new job in Central Florida. He and Roberta relocate with the children in Cocoa Beach. He is still in need of MH services.
