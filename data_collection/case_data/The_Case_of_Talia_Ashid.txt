### Key Action Items:
MAIN/CURRENT EVENT: Talia is a 19 year old female student who was sexually assaulted on campus after finishing her evening shift at the campus gym. As she left the gym on the academic side of campus walking toward the dorms, she was approached by one of the male gym guests.  He asked if she wanted to catch a movie at his dorm.  When she arrived at his dorm her offered her a drink. After a few minutes, she started getting lightheaded. He forced himself on her and sexually assaulted her orally and vaginally.  She vaguely recalled him using offensive slurs while ripping off her hijab. Eventually, Talia passed out from the trauma. She woke to find herself bleeding, she did not have enough clothing to cover herself, and she could barely walk. Eventually, she found her belongings and called her ‘Big’ (sorority sister mentor) who immediately came to get Talia. Following the attack, she no longer wears her hijab on campus for fear that she will be targeted again.
PRECIPITATING EVENTS: Until the recent attack, Talia absolutely loved being an on-campus student. She had met lots of friends, excelled in her studies, and felt very comfortable everywhere she went, e.g. the dorms, class, and social settings. Her parents were hesitant when she first approached them about attending college. They were worried about how she would be treated if she would be safe, and even if they would all be okay with distance. Talia knowing her parents and how much they valued education shared different campus write ups on diversity and inclusion. She shared the campus safety report from the following year. She even organized a family meeting to show the elder Ashids how to use Zoom and Facebook Messenger, so that they could talk face-to-face everyday.
If someone would have told Talia that her life would change so rapidly in 24 hours - she would have never believed them.
Scenario A
: Perpetrator is identified as a student who has frequented the gym Talia works at.
Scenario B
