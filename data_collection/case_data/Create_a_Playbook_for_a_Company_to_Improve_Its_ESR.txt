Title: Create a Playbook for a Company to Improve Its ESR

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility, Growth Strategy

### Background and Objective:
Hydrus is looking to ensure that our end-to-end ESG software tool is, for all intents and purposes, an end-to-end tool. We want to ensure that our clients can identify the data that needs to be collected, gather information, make calculations based on the collected data, report the input, derive insights on that data, and subsequently make more sustainable business decisions based on the calculated information. Our clients’ most significant ESG issues are: “What information should be disclosed?” and “Where can I find the necessary data in my organization?
The differences in how industries handle ESG is enormous. To best meet our client’s needs, we need to understand the end-to-end process in each industry and how they differ. Once we identify the differences, we can determine the KPIs for each sector and understand their impacts.
For many organizations, mapping out their ESG  (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals is an essential early step on their CSR journey. However, turning those goals into actions often requires large-scale operational and cultural shifts. Each organization will have to shift towards an ESG-focused culture. After determining their most important ESG goals, organizations will take different paths to get to that goal depending on the industry in which the organization is. Part of data aggregation is learning the various pieces of data that need to be collected. Sometimes, calculations must be made based on collected raw data. In other words, aggregated raw data is not the final figure required for a specific metric.

### Key Action Items:
After getting familiar with the company, its vision, and its mission, we want you to understand the ESG goals and how Hydrus helps other organizations toward their CSR journey. We ask you to identify industry-specific standards and ESG risk factors. You will recommend strategies that help us increase revenue and generate a positive social and environmental impact. Finally, you’ll present ideas on the best combination of ESG strategies and tools.
