Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing, Sales & Business Development, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
Design effective sales processes and tools for the sales representatives to provide customers with consistent positive experiences and turn more potential clients into customers. The company’s primary goal is to secure 50 new accounts (retail, online, and food service) by the end of 2023. You’re asked to help the team reach its yearly target.
OLOL attends marketing events through Range Me and ECRM. Participants will be required to create sales packets (presentation, FAQs, sales sheet) and attend presentations to assist in answering questions about the product.
Oh Lait! Oh Lait! was inspired by the fruits, the drinks, and the sweet confections from Latin America and the Caribbean. As a young girl, founder, and CEO, Soroya Pognon remembers the best conversations and memories around the kitchen table. There, she learned how to make food, bake cakes and make ice cream. Years later, she took the simple ice cream recipe and experimented with various fruits her parents often talked of. She soon realized that she not only created something people loved, but it was something that immediately transported them to another world- a spoonful of paradise.
In this study, you are challenged to support the company in determining the most effective sales methods that help them grow and reach its planned KPIs in 2023 and 2024.

### Key Action Items:
After you’ve understood the company’s vision, mission, and goals, you’re asked to assist the company in developing its sales processes. Firstlyreview and analyze current E-comm platforms (website, Mable, Amazon, FoodService Direct, Cloud Retail, GoPuff) and make recommendations to improve overall traffic to each site. Make recommendations to the social media team based on what days/ times people visited the site and purchased and determine if there was a correlation to posts. Work with the Sales consultant on retail sales strategy for 2023 and 2024 every week. Work on the customer journey and customer person exercises together to ensure we engage the right customers at every step of the process. Once completed, ensure that all stakeholders (contracted persons and interns) are well-versed in who the target customers are and how we target them.
