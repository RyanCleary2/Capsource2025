Topics: Case Management, Courts, Corrections, and Law Enforcement, Facilitation, Mediation, Conflict Resolution, Individual and Family Advocacy

### Background and Objective:
Nayati Locklear is a 10-year-old, male who is currently in the United States of America (U.S.A.) foster care system due to a history of behavioral health issues and possible neglect by his biological mother. He was recently placed in an intensive foster care home and appears to be thriving by child welfare standards. This progress has prompted the current foster parents to seek legal rights to adopt him or, at the very least, a secure permanent placement in their home. In preparation for the upcoming court hearing to terminate parental rights of Nayati’s mother, Seke, (Nayati’s father is deceased), the social worker discovered Nayati’s biological family is primarily Native American including both parents and several grandparents. All are part of the Coharie Tribe, which is a federally recognized Indian tribe. This data was not documented in any of Nayati’s previous case records. Based on the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978 this impacts several aspects of his case including, but not limited to the terms of his ability to be adopted and/or placed with a non-Native family, as well as, rights and responsibilities of the State.

### Key Action Items:
Nayati Locklear is a 10-year-old, male who is currently in the United States of America (U.S.A.) foster care system due to a history of behavioral health issues and possible neglect by his biological mother. Nayati refused to attend school, was verbally and physically violent toward both his mother and his brother, and had refused to eat or take his medication for the last 24 hours. He had locked himself in the bathroom and refused to open the door. After losing custody of three children to her ex-husband and their biological father, Tim, Seke has no trust in the U.S. judicial system. She was hesitant to call the police for assistance; but as Nayati’s behavior escalated, she felt she had no other choice.
There are multiple child protection reports involving Nayati’s conduct along with concerns that his mother was not giving him the medication he has been prescribed to reduce his disruptive and antisocial behavior. Nayati has been diagnosed with a mood disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type; and learning disorder, NOS. He has also been receiving special education services in school for several subjects. The immediate investigation revealed that Nayati missed two follow-up medical appointments, and is not taking his medication as prescribed. The investigating caseworker concluded there was credible evidence that Nayati’s needs were not being met. As a result, a CPS case was officially opened, and Nayati was removed from his family and temporarily placed in a group home setting.
In preparation for the upcoming court hearing to terminate the parental rights of Nayati’s mother, the case worker discovered that Nayati is a member of a Native American tribe. This new information has critical implications for how the case is handled.
Scenario A:
Seke, Nayati’s mother, wants to return to the reservation and raise Nayati and Elan III. She is seeking tribal assistance and council, as well as, seeking legal assistance under the ICWA. The Coharie Tribe has offered resources and both maternal and paternal grandparents are supportive of assisting with Nayati. Nayati is supportive of this decision and would like to be reunited with his mother and brother.
Scenario B:
Seke would like to relinquish her parental rights to Nayati. She feels that due to her own health issues, as well as, how well Nayati has thrived in foster care she would like to see Nayati placed with the American couple. Nayati’s maternal grandparents do not agree. They have sought counsel and assistance from the National Indian Child Welfare Association (NICWA). They are requesting Nayati to be returned to their tribal community and that they legally are allowed to raise him. Nayati would prefer to continue to live with the American couple.
Scenario C:
The American couple withdraws their application based upon the new information and the child's status under ICWA. As a result, the Coharie Tribe petitions the court to invalidate the out-of-home placement and transfer the case to tribal court. Nayati is temporarily placed by NICWA in a temporary home within the tribal community.
