Title: Create a Communication Strategy for Building Farm-to-University (F2U) Partnerships

Topics: No Topics Found

### Background and Objective:
The Happy Valley Meat Company (HVM) needs a playbook to build its university partner network. HVM needs to know the “right connections” in organizations (e.g., Department of Agriculture), colleges, and universities within the region for building F2U partnerships. Furthermore, they want to know the most effective way to reach these audiences through strategic communication channels and content.
Happy Valley Meat Company (HVM)’s mission is to improve the lives of the people and the animals that feed us by providing chefs, whether at home or in fine-dining restaurants, so that people can access ethically-raised meat from family farmers. HVM purchases whole animals from farmers who work with small-scale processors to portion our meat and sells every part of the animal to people who want it. As a certified B Corp, HVM considers its impact on partners, employees, the community, and the environment. HVM farmers are paid a significant fixed premium over commodity prices for humanely raised animals. This ensures better lives for farmers, a better ecosystem for animals, and better food for all.
In support of their mission, Happy Valley Meat Company (HVM) works with universities and schools to help them source meat from local farmers, a surprisingly difficult task with all the insurance and red tape required. Though their targets are higher education institutions, they are still determining which departments and people they should engage in and the best approaches to reach them. HVM has found some fantastic school partners, but finding the appropriate contacts at a school can be difficult, and they often need more time to respond.
Happy Valley Meat Company would like to find more schools interested in partnering by identifying the target audience. They also want to know the most effective communication channels to showcase some exciting work they already do with schools.

### Key Action Items:
After you become familiar with the organization and its vision, mission, and activities, please identify the target audience(s) HVM should focus on to expand its network. We ask you to create a communication campaign strategy for the previously identified target audience(s) and define the financial budget of this project. Finally, we’d like to see your predictions about the long-term impact of the new relationships on the company. Explain why it’s worth pursuing those recommended schools and partners.
