Title: The Clock is Ticking: Deep Sea Mining?

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility

### Background and Objective:
In the 19th century, the British HMS Challenger set off on the first global research expedition to gather data on ocean temperatures, marine life, and geology of the seafloor. This was the first oceanographic ship replete with its own laboratories, microscopes, and other scientific equipment on board. Scientists explored the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans and discovered the first polymetallic nodules.1 These nodules form at a depth of 4,500 meters in the ocean, grow a mere centimeter every million years, and comprise rare-earth minerals including manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and cobalt (Co). These base minerals will be essential to fueling the advanced development of renewable energy. However, little is understood of the environmental impacts of deep sea mining. As land-based resources have become depleted, commercial interest has turned to mining these minerals at the bottom of the sea. The case involves multiple stakeholders and raises economic, legal, and ethical issues worthy of consideration.
A bountiful supply of nodules exists on the abyssal plains in Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million square kilometer area between Hawaii and Mexico. Estimates suggest that the CCZ holds six times more cobalt (Co) and three times more nickel (Ni) than all known land-based stores, as well as vast deposits manganese (Mn) and a substantial amount of copper (Cu). These extraordinary reserves could profoundly impact global supply chains. Of particular interest is cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) as both are key components of lithium-ion batteries, which at present, offer the best energy density of any commercially available battery.2 The high energy density makes them ideal for use in cell phones, electric vehicles, and grid-level energy storage. The World Bank found that production of rare-earth minerals such as cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) could increase an astonishing 500 percent by 2050, to meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.3 A spate of countries and companies have begun to engage in the exploration, research, and development phase of deep sea mining, tantalized by the prospect of tapping into the enormously valuable nodules.
The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is an autonomous international organization established under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, the ISA is mandated with organizing, regulating, and controlling all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The area encompasses nearly two hundred and sixty million square kilometers, just over 50 per cent of the entire seafloor on earth, which the ISA simply refers to as “the Area.” The ISA is in the process of developing regulations for commercial activity and any contractors wishing to undertake mining operations in the international deep seabed area will need to abide by their regulations. Ultimately, the economic benefits of deep seabed mining -most likely in the form of royalties paid to the ISA- are to be shared for the "benefit of mankind as a whole" with particular emphasis on the developing countries that lack the technology and capital to carry out seabed mining for themselves.4
Advocates of deep sea mining have maintained it holds the promise of relieving some of the enormous burden from mining rare-earth minerals on land. Mining nodules will support growing populations, urbanization, and decarbonization. Unlike land-based mines, deep sea mining will not create open-pits, lead to deforestation, or produce toxic mining wastes. Seabed mining will not involve the relocation of people en masse nor will it result in the exploitation of indigenous people or employ child labor. Furthermore, a unique characteristic of nodules is the presence of multiple commodities in one deposit, making deep sea mining much more efficient and ecologically safe than land-based mining.5 Critics have called for a stay on deep sea mining given the seabed is largely unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored. While the seabed may seem inhospitable, life exists in, on, and around nodules. The mining, pumping, and cleaning process of the nodules will generate sediment plumes, noise, and vibrations, not only destroying micro and macro fauna, but also disturbing marine mammals such as dolphins and whales, which could force them to flee from their natural habitat. In the absence of any scientific consensus on the long-term impacts of deep sea mining, scant oversight of industrial activity, and the fragility of deep sea ecosystems, many scientists have argued the only safe way to proceed is not to.6

### Key Action Items:
First, we want you to analyze the case from a stakeholder perspective and collect the pros and cons of investing in more research before moving toward deep-sea mining partnerships and contracts. Elaborate on an analysis of the Democratic Republic of Congo producing 60 percent of raw cobalt (Co), and China supplying 80 percent of refined cobalt. Should it be an economic concern?
What are your concerns with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulating all mineral-related activities beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, if any?
Finally, you are asked to examine the environmental impact of land-based mining. According to your research, do you think deep-sea mining is a more sustainable alternative? Why or why not?
