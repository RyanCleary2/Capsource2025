### Key Action Items:
First, we want you to analyze the case from a stakeholder perspective and collect the pros and cons of investing in more research before moving toward deep-sea mining partnerships and contracts. Elaborate on an analysis of the Democratic Republic of Congo producing 60 percent of raw cobalt (Co), and China supplying 80 percent of refined cobalt. Should it be an economic concern?
What are your concerns with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulating all mineral-related activities beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, if any?
Finally, you are asked to examine the environmental impact of land-based mining. According to your research, do you think deep-sea mining is a more sustainable alternative? Why or why not?
