Title: Develop an Expansion Strategy for the American Cancer Society's Associate Board of Ambassadors

Topics: Growth Strategy

### Background and Objective:
The American Cancer Society (ACS) is looking to nationally scale the Associate Board of Ambassadors (ABOA) strategy they've developed in Chicago. The ABOA in Chicago is the largest and most successful board of young up-and-coming leaders that are committed to serving ACS through fundraising and events. The Chicago ABOA currently includes 150 young professionals who raise $500,000 successfully each year. The leadership team in Chicago is asking you to assemble a launch playbook for ABOAs in new markets.
They expect the playbook will include detailed strategies, tactics, and tools to jumpstart the ABOA program in new markets, identify the markets that are most ripe for an ABOA, establish a set of expectations and rewards for new cities, and ultimately help shed light on how the ABOA strategy will impact the ACS in the mid-to-long term.

### Key Action Items:
The American Cancer Society (ACS) is interested in learning what strategies other organizations have successfully used to expand their board of ambassador programs into new markets and cities. In particular, they would like to know the best practices for attracting and retaining rising community leaders who share in the mission and values of the ACS organization, and are looking for your top 3 recommendations for recruiting ideal candidates.
