Title: Helping a Children’s Literacy Platform Scale Internationally

Topics: Growth Strategy, International Affairs

### Background and Objective:
CommonLit is a nonprofit EdTech company focused on literacy for grades 3-12, dedicated to ensuring that all students graduate high school with the reading and writing skills necessary for college and career. While our team is passionate about exploring product-based and international expansion opportunities, much of our day-to-day focus must remain on improving our current support for U.S. teachers and students. We must ensure that we meet the U.S. Department of Education IAL grant requirements. Therefore, it would be greatly beneficial for student consultants to conduct market research and data analysis.
There are two directions that CommonLit considers: expanding to countries with the highest need or expanding to countries with the best market fit for our resources. We would select from countries referenced in the Google.org Education Initiative to expand to countries with the most increased need. Google.org offers grant money for companies developing scalable tech solutions to close gaps in education outcomes in these countries, and we are considering applying for this funding. To expand in countries with the best market fit for our resources, we would want to assess market fit and determine which countries CommonLit could most easily penetrate. This direction would include research concerning significant players in the reading education market and their offerings, penetration of 1:1 computing (one laptop or device per student) in schools, prominence of English education in schooling, and more.

### Key Action Items:
After you’ve understood the background and values of CommonLit, you’ll be asked to analyze the global market and propose an international expansion strategy for the company. Find the best-fitting countries and institutions that align with CommonLit’s aspiration; moreover, consider the company's work's broader social, educational, and political impact.
