Main/Current Event:
Kellie, Janice’s boss at the local hospital, referred Janice to an EAP because Janice had become increasingly distracted and recently missed a few shifts at work. Janice insists that the reason she missed work was that she needed to pick Zane up from school. Late in the school day, he often complains of a stomach ache. Several times, the school nurse called her and asked that she pick him up. Janice has taken Zane to two pediatricians who have not identified anything physically causing Zane’s stomach ache.In talking with the social worker at EAP Janice confesses that there are sometimes problems at home.  Thurston is friendly and personable and everyone loves him. But there is another side of him when he is at home. He sometimes is unpredictable and easily angered. About two months after starting his job as a mechanic, he was terminated after a conflict with the manager. Thurston wants to open his own shop, but he doesn't have great credit. He had Janice open several credit cards in her name and took the maximum cash advance available. Janice didn't want to have the credit cards but didn't feel that she could say no to Thurston.Janice says Thurston has promised that after they/he opens the shop, they will get married. But he doesn't have money for an engagement ring because he's making plans to open his own shop. Janice is not sure what he is doing to open the shop, but a couple of times she asked him, Thurston ridiculed her by saying she is not smart enough to even read a business plan.
Precipitating events:
After they moved, Janice quickly got a job working in the cafeteria at the local hospital. Although it was very different from her job at the dental office, Janice felt it would be a great opportunity to allow her to utilize aspects of her culinary degree. She really likes her job. In the cafeteria, she can work in the kitchen without interacting with anyone, which is rare in the food industry. Janice is quiet and shy and avoids making eye contact in general, which was one of the main reasons she was never promoted at the dental office. At the hospital, the staff quickly notices that she’s a hardworking employee. Additionally, Janice’s supervisor, Kellie, adores her and she has no complaints.Unfortunately, home life is not the same. Sometimes Janice and Thurston argue about money and other issues to the point where neighbors have actually complained about Thurston’s yelling. One night after a big game, a neighbor called the police because of their arguing. Janice told the responding officer that Thurston was drinking and that he gets loud when he drinks. Janice stresses that Thurston would never hit her and says she's not afraid of him. However, she also indicates he is ugly when he doesn't get what he wants. Nevertheless, Janice is quick to emphasize that she feels lucky to be with him because he is good with Zane and is everything she has ever wanted in a partner.Janice is somewhat concerned about Zane because he doesn't have many friends. After school, he plays with Legos quietly by himself. Janice wishes he had more friends, but she knows that he will be okay because she has never had many friends either. Zane had quite a few more friends at his old school including his cousins. She often blames herself because the family had to move in the middle of the school year for Thurston’s job.
Scenario 1:
Thurston is emotionally abusing Janice (and by observation Zane). Additional IPV - fiscally and utilizing the threat of physical violence in damage to items in the house, e.g. furniture, holes in the wall, etc. He is aware of his behavior and wants to change, but does not know where to start. Janice is hopeful that he will make positive changes. She and Zane remain in Baltimore with Thurston.
Scenario 2:
Thurston is emotionally abusing Janice (and by observation Zane). Additional IPV - fiscally and utilizing the threat of physical violence in damage to items in the house, e.g. furniture, holes in the wall, etc. Janice, concerned about Zane’s well-being and possibly losing custody of him, attempts to access services to relocate back to Berlin. Thurston cares about both individuals and is supportive of them moving back to Janice’s hometown.
Scenario 3:
Thurston is emotionally abusing Janice (and by observation Zane). Additional IPV - fiscally and utilizing the threat of physical violence in damage to items in the house, e.g. furniture, holes in the wall, etc. Janice, concerned about Zane’s well-being and possibly losing custody of him, attempts to access services to relocate back to Berlin. Thurston is not supportive. Violence escalates including undocumented threats against Janice’s life, her car tires being slashed, and stalking. Today, Thurston picked Zane up from school without Janice’s knowledge.
