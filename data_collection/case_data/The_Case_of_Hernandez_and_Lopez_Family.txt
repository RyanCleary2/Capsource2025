### Key Action Items:
Main/Current Situation
: Ana was rushed to the hospital by her parents because she had been vomiting non-stop for several days.  Ana was hospitalized for almost a week. During this time she was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease.  Ana was sent home with a medication regimen (steroids and immunosuppressants), which the parents did not purchase. The cost of the medication for an individual without insurance was impossible for the parents to afford. In addition, their own cultural beliefs about the use of botanicas (as opposed to prescription pharmaceuticals) led them to utilize their local community for additional medical guidance. The family consulted Tomas Sr’s
Abuela
, Mary, who was a community botanicas medicine woman and followed her recommendations to try helping Ana keep food down and gain weight.Due to the progression of her illness, Ana was once again admitted to the hospital for dehydration.  After questioning the parents about her symptoms and treatment implementation, the doctor made a child abuse report for medical neglect.
Precipitating events:
Ana has had health issues and recently her health has taken a turn for the worse. This is her first year in primary school.  Since the school year started, she has missed over 45 days due to illness. She has been sent home on several occasions due to illness.  The school nurse referred the family to a pediatrician several times, but the parents did not follow through on the referral mainly due to fear of losing their children. Several of their community members have been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and separated from their children. This has resulted in a community-wide approach of accessing more culturally traditional models of medicine for their children in the use of botanicas. Lizette and Tomas are attentive parents who care about their family and do not want to see them separated.Also, during this time Ana’s brother, Tomas, who has been in overall excellent health most of his life, has been struggling to see the board while in class, recently.  While he is normally a very good student, his grades have begun to suffer.  Both Tomas and Ana are failing to thrive in their coursework, and now the school has become increasingly concerned about Ana’s absences and lack of medical documentation for what is clearly a chronic illness.
Scenario 1:
CPS investigation is launched. The parents' undocumented status is discovered and ICE is contacted. The children are removed from the household and the parents face deportation. Tomas’ grandmother, Mary, contacts various agencies hoping to avoid the deportation of her family and also have the children placed temporarily in her home. She has historically struggled to navigate various systems and agencies when needing assistance due to barriers as an older adult who speaks English as a second language.
Scenario 2:
CPS is contacted. The investigator meets with the family and completes a house visit/evaluation. ICE is contacted. Panicking and scared of losing their children the parents take the children and flee in the middle of the night. Two weeks later they are detained at the border in Texas trying to enter Mexico.
Scenario 3:
CPS is contacted and an investigation is launched. During this time, Lizzete, who is of indigenous descent from the Mayan population, is contacted by a United States tribal community who is willing to assist her with citizenship and legal assistance. Precedence has been set with indigenous tribes in the U.S.A. previously assisting individuals from Mexico and Canada who have tribal relations.
