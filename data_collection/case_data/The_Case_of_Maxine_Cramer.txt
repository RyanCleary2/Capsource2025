### Key Action Items:
MAIN CURRENT EVENT: Joanne Johnson, 49 African American female, was recently told by Maxine’s neighbor that Maxine was engaging in prostitution. Joanne already had deep concerns about the housing community that Maxine lived in, River Oaks, given the fact that Maxine had a previous prostitution charge and seemed to make questionable choices about the men in her life based on her environment. Joanne has attempted to talk with Maxine about these issues in the past, which always results in Maxine cutting off contact with Joanne for a period of time. Concerned that the children will not have her as a resource, Joanne decided to report Maxine for child neglect and endangerment without notifying Maxine first.
When the Child Protective Investigator shows up at Maxine’s home, Maxine is devastated. She is angry because she cannot believe someone has reported her. She is currently not speaking to Joanne and believes it could be her, but cannot confirm.  Also, Maxine is afraid if she shares honestly about her work she will lose her children. In addition, she fears one of her johns’ responses if she is reported. The main issues presented: child welfare, the legality of work, mental health, and poverty.
Precipitating Events
:
Maxine grew up in a single-parent household with her mom Joanne. Joanne was often distant and withdrawn. Maxine would tell her friends that her mom never told her that she loved Maxine and rarely if ever hugged her. Joanne did provide for Maxine. Maxine was grateful for her nice clothes, her neighborhood, and the fact that at least Joanne was present. Maxine had never met her father. When Maxine was about 8 years old, she had asked her mom about her dad & Joanne said that he was not part of their lives, then she quickly changed the subject. Later that night, Maxine heard Joanne in her bedroom crying. Maxine felt terrible and never brought him up again.
Maxine did well in school, but after graduation, she decided to take a gap year. She was not sure what career path she wanted to take and she did not want to spend money on college until she knew exactly what she wanted to do. During this time, she got a job waiting tables at the nearby Army base Fort Campbell. While she works there she meets Carter Dixon who is enlisted in the Army. They date on and off for about a year before becoming exclusive. After her gap year, she decides she wants a degree in management and enrolls in the local community college. She quits waiting tables and gets an on-campus work study. She and Carter are closer than ever although they do not see each other regularly due to conflicting schedules. One night at dinner, they begin to talk about marriage and a family. Maxine badly wants a family of her own. They decide to start having unprotected sex.
A few months after her 20th birthday Carter tells Maxine that he is to be deployed to Afghanistan. He asks her to marry him before he deploys, but Maxine declines. She wants their day to be special, not a rush ordeal. Carter leaves a few days later & Maxine never sees him again. Carter Dixon dies the same month he arrives in Afghanistan. He was one of three servicemen killed in action (KIA) at a roadside bombing in Ghazni Providence, Afghanistan in November 2018. Joseph, Carter’s son, is born eight months later. Due to the fact that Maxine and Carter were not married, as well as, unable to match DNA - she is unable to claim benefits for Joseph.
After Joseph was born, Maxine struggled with daycare and providing for him. Joann offered to help, but would often critique where Maxine lived, the fact that she had quit college and Maxine’s current job. Maxine detested fighting especially with the only parent she had, so she often withdrew to give her and her mother space. Over time, those periods became longer and longer. Sometimes Maxine and Joanne did not talk for months. This saddens Maxine because her mother is very kind and loving to her grandchildren - something she never received from Joanne.
It was during one of these periods when Joanne and Maxine were not speaking that Maxine took a job working as a cocktail waitress at one of the local strip clubs. When Maxine was fired for repeated tardiness due to childcare issues, a friend suggested an alternative way to earn money where child care would not be an issue. Maxine picked up sex work with three long-term customers. All three men are married. One of them, Jim Ricotta,  is the father of both Timothy and Noa. He has repeatedly promised to leave his wife, yet never does. When Maxine has tried to establish paternity or cut him out of her life, he has threatened to harm Joseph if she does not do as he says.
Scenario A:
Maxine meets with the CPI and provides full disclosure. She shares that she has been working as a sex worker and explains the dynamic of her relationship with one of her johns who she knows is the father of two of her children. She states that he is the only customer she engages in unprotected sex with. She also states she fears for her oldest son’s life. The Investigator contacts the U.S. military about the government’s responsibility to Carter Dixon’s heir, Joseph Cramer.
Scenario B:
Due to fear of retaliation from Timothy and Noa’s biological father, Jim Ricotta, Maxine misses multiple scheduled meetings and home visits. The children are removed from the home. Maxine’s mother, Joanne, petitions the courts for custody of the children. She is supportive of allowing Maxine supervised visitation with the children.
Scenario C:
Upon learning that Maxine is under investigation for possible sex work, Jim Ricotta, Noa, and Timothy’s possible biological father contact the courts requesting a paternity test and if he is confirmed the father - custody of the two children. He states that his marriage has had issues, but they have sought marriage counseling and would like to raise the two boys if they are indeed his biological children. He is open to the boys visiting their brother, Joseph, but would not want them to have visits with Maxine due to her line of work.
