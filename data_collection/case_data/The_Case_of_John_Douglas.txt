### Background and Objective:
John Douglas is a 51 year old African American. He is a military veteran who served during the Gulf War. He has trouble sleeping, experiences nightmares, and struggles with ongoing financial insecurity. In addition, the recent increase of media coverage and conversations concerning police brutality against people of color (POC) has been very triggering for John. He recognizes that this could happen to him and the fear keeps him up at night. Due to his lack of sleep, he is also concerned about losing his job and then losing his home. John is an only child and has never been married. He is close to his mother, Adele Douglas, but he does not want to burden or worry her with the issues. She has often struggled in the past to fully grasp the impact of his military experience. Adele has stated on more than one occasion that
at least John got to come home after his military service
. John’s father, Richard, died while serving in the Vietnam War. Adele never remarried and raised John by herself. She was vigilant about instilling in John the importance of being independent and never asking anyone for help.

### Key Action Items:
Main/Current:
Mr. Douglas is a Gulf War Army Veteran seeking services for the first time at his local veteran community non-profit.  Today, he came into the community center to inquire about speaking to someone due to the fact that he is having an increase in nightmares. He is also experiencing hypervigilance along with multiple psychosocial stressors resulting from several recent incidents of police violence against African American men. Seeing the images on the news has resulted in an increase in violent nightmares. He stated he fears “this could happen to me.”During intake Mr. Douglas states that he transports military defense equipment for a local tech company in Central Florida. He shared that the lack of sleep is interfering with his work, at times, “almost falling asleep behind the wheel.” He is concerned he will lose his job and ultimately his home. He states that, “Without my check, I will lose everything. I cannot lose my house. That is all I have.” In addition, Mr. Douglas stated that he was uncomfortable seeking services. “I don’t want people to think I can’t handle things.” He reported he keeps to himself most of the time. He occasionally communicates with other veterans at a local coffee shop but lives on his own. He visits his mother in a neighboring town and takes care of her lawn. He reports that he loves her but that she does not fully understand his experiences in the Army and prefers to keep that to himself.With these anxieties and concerns, John feels that it is imperative to meet with someone. He is accessing the veteran’s community center because it is in his hometown. The Veterans Affairs (VA) office is in the city, and although it offers more services, it is too far of a drive for John to make with his current work schedule. John states that his fear of being pulled over by the police while driving for work and sleep deprivation are the main drivers for him accessing services currently.
Scenario A:
On his way home from work one night, John’s fear becomes a reality. He sees flashing lights in his rear view. He anxiously looks for a well lit spot, but is unable to find one so he just pulls over. Unknown to John, his car matches a stolen vehicle report.  The police officer, believing that John was trying to flee and that the car is stolen, approaches the car with his gun drawn. John begins having flashbacks from when he was in combat in the Gulf War and begins experiencing chest pains, sweating profusely. The officer believes John is having a heart attack and calls for an ambulance. John is admitted into the hospital and then once he is physically stable is transferred to the psychiatric wing for evaluation.
Scenario B:
John begins meeting with the social worker, but as he begins unpacking his mental health challenges he finds that his sleeping and anxiety are becoming worse not better. Believing that talking about his issues is “obviously a waste of time” he stops attending sessions. One day at work John falls asleep on the job. His employer is understanding, but mandates counseling in order for John to keep his job. John does not know if he should quit his job and find a new one and if he should return to the same social worker or find a new one. He starts to believe that he may not be able to be helped.
Scenario C:
John has been meeting with the social worker now for a few weeks. The social worker believes that John needs additional assistance in terms of medication, which the SW is not qualified to prescribe. In addition, there is a concern that beyond PTSD, John may have Gulf War syndrome and needs to be evaluated to receive help and possible compensation. Upon seeing the referral is for the VA, John refuses to go. He states that he does not want to be ‘doped up all the time’ and ‘does not trust them.’
