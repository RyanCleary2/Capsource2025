Title: Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Focused on Community Engagement at True Religion

Topics: Marketing, Organizational Culture, Talent Management

### Background and Objective:
True Religion, a powerhouse denim brand since the early 2000s, has undergone significant restructuring and recently emerged from bankruptcy. As part of its reinvention, the company is working to revitalize both its business and corporate culture. With improved financial performance and the ability to pay bonuses, True Religion has seen positive cultural shifts and is ready to build on this momentum by expanding its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
The company’s Human Resources (HR) team seeks assistance in developing a robust DEI strategy that not only strengthens internal culture but also engages employees in community outreach. Employees are eager to participate in initiatives such as a Culture Committee and Diversity Council, with a focus on serving underserved communities—particularly children. True Religion’s DEI vision emphasizes diversity across gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, ability, and age, aligning with the company’s mission to create meaningful social impact.
This project invites students to develop a comprehensive DEI strategy, focusing on leveraging employee engagement to support True Religion’s business and community objectives.

### Key Action Items:
