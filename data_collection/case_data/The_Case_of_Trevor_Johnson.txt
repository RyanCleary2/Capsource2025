Title: The Case of Trevor Johnson

Topics: Facilitation, Mediation, Conflict Resolution

### Background and Objective:
Trevor Johnson is a 19-year-old black male. He is a second-year out-of-state public college student who resides in one of the dorms with his two roommates, Mark and Jack who are both white. Mark is also a 19-year-old second year. Jack is an 18-year-old first-year college student. All three arrived at the counseling center last night due to the fact that the roommates were concerned about Trevor experiencing auditory hallucinations (AH). Mark and Jack reported that recently Trevor shared that he hears voices and has for several years. In addition, according to the roommates Trevor has become increasingly irritable and started isolating himself. One of Trevor’s roommates, Jack, stated that he heard Trevor responding aloud to the voices yesterday, which made him feel even more concerned. Jack’s brother developed similar symptoms about two years ago. Mark is worried about Trevor, but is also growing uncomfortable with his behavior and is a little afraid of what Trevor might do.

### Key Action Items:
Presenting Situation Main/Current Event:
Trevor is a 19-year-old black male, appearing in person at the university counseling center requesting services. He is accompanied by his roommates following their expressed concerns about Trevor experiencing auditory hallucinations (AH)
.
Trevor reports that he’s heard voices off and on for the past three years and that the voices are generally comforting and non-distressing.Trevor states that hearing voices is something both his mother and father talked about frequently when he was growing up. He noted that hearing voices was often a spiritual and comforting experience, as described by both of his parents. Trevor recalls that he started hearing voices at the age of 16, and didn’t find the experience to be disturbing or abnormal given his family norms and the experiences he had growing up.Trevor’s two roommates brought Trevor to the university counseling center because they have been increasingly concerned about the voices Trevor recently told them about, as well as Trevor’s increasing irritability and isolation. One of Trevor’s roommates, Jack, stated that he thought he heard Trevor responding aloud to the voices. Jack’s brother was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, so his concern is that his friend/roommate may have the same mental health issue. Mark is feeling more on the uncomfortable and slightly afraid side of things. He grew up in a small town with little exposure to people of different religious backgrounds, almost no diversity, and has been sheltered most of his life.Jack stated that he saw Trevor yesterday in the hallway having what appeared to be a conversation. When he went over to say hello - Trevor was actually alone. Jack asked him who he was talking to and Trevor said that he was responding to voices that often talked to him.During the one-on-one intake process with the school counselor, Trevor reported that he’s been withdrawing from his roommates and a number of his usual day-to-day activities. After he experienced multiple instances of microaggressions from his white roommates he began keeping more to himself. Upon meeting Mark, Trevor's roommate, he remarked on how "articulate and well-spoken" Trevor was. In addition, one day while eating lunch Jack stated that he “didn’t see color.” He also feels that his roommates are keeping secrets from him and that they are familiar with each other in a way that makes him uncomfortable. He states that these experiences made him feel suspicious of the integrity of his friendship with his roommates.
Risk and Protective Factors:
Out-of-state college student - no support system in close proximity, has a strong sense of faith and good relationship with parents, experienced microaggressions in the past both academically and at work.
Scenario A:
Trevor’s relationship with his religion is the core of his morality. His parents and most of his community had stated that they had a special relationship with God. When he turned 16, he began hearing voices guiding him to help him live a strong Christian lifestyle. The voices had increased over the last several months. Trevor believed this was due to the microaggressions from his roommates and one of his college professors. Trevor does not exhibit any other signs of possible mental health issues and appears relatively well-adjusted.
Scenario B:
Trevor has purposely exaggerated his auditory hallucinations. He does hear voices, but they are less frequent than when he was at home. He is experiencing microaggressions at college. In addition, he believes that his roommates are secretly in a relationship and this has caused Trevor to distance himself further. Due to the secrecy, as well as, a direct conflict with his spiritual relationship with the church - he has isolated himself and many times stays up long hours instead of returning to his dorm room. He believes he is unable to hear the voices as often because of his “roommates’ lifestyle choices”.
Scenario C:
After meeting with the school counselor several times, Trevor discloses that he is concerned about his mental health. He exhibits signs of paranoia, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts. He has not shared this information previously because he knows that suicide is a sin and he does not want to disappoint his parents.
