### Background and Objective:
141 Hawaii is contracted by Friends of Hawaii Charities as a full-service partner to help organize, manage, and produce the Sony Open in Hawaii PGA TOUR Event. 141 Hawaii assists with all aspects of coordinating the tournament, including event marketing, sponsorship sales, ticket sales, event set-up, on-site operations, player relations, food service, and volunteer programming. Each year, 141 Hawaii leverages its relationship with Friends of Hawaii Charities to organize volunteers for the Sony Open in Hawaii. In recent years, since the COVID Pandemic, 141 Hawaii and Friends of Hawaii Charities have been experiencing challenges in effectively recruiting volunteers for the program despite offering attractive incentives.
