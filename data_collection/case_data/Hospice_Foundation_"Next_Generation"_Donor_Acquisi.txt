Title: Hospice Foundation "Next Generation" Donor Acquisition Strategy

Topics: Growth Strategy, Talent Management

### Background and Objective:
Identify "next generation donors" (individuals aged 45 and under) to the Hospice Foundation. These potential donors represent a significant opportunity for long-term support and engagement. Our goal is to develop a tailored strategy, fostering lasting connections and inspiring them to become advocates for our cause.

### Key Action Items:
To achieve our desired results, we will undertake the following activities and action items: Conduct thorough research on the size and giving patterns of the target donor demographic (ages 25-45) to understand their potential impact on the Hospice Foundation over the next 10-15 years. Investigate and analyze non-profit organizations that have successfully cultivated significant younger donor bases, focusing on sectors such as children's causes, animal-related organizations, mental health support, athletic-related causes, and religious organizations. Study the various events, activities, and solicitation methods these successful organizations employ to attract support. This research will help us identify effective strategies for engaging potential donors. It may also involve creating an advisory group to assist in developing these strategies.Develop a comprehensive donor acquisition strategy tailored to our target demographic:a. Identifying potential donors locally to ensure personalized outreach and community engagement.
b. Matching potential donors with specific Hospice Foundation programs that align with their affinity for support, maximizing their connection to our cause.
c. Crafting compelling messages that resonate with the values and interests of the younger demographic.
d. Utilizing appropriate channels, including social media platforms and geofencing, to effectively reach and engage potential donors.
By implementing these activities and action items, we aim to attract and cultivate a thriving community of "next-generation donors," securing the future sustainability and growth of the Hospice Foundation.
