### Background and Objective:
GLANCE is a led ticker designed to show you your data how you want it. The company asks you to identify strategies to increase brand awareness. Furthermore, GLANCE is considering expanding in the B2B segment, so help them pinpoint B2B areas and prepare marketing and communication strategies to target them.
About GLANCE: “Our team first met in undergrad and has since worked together as engineers and consultants in the tech space. We have worked with several Fortune 100 companies in the deep tech space as well. Overall our team has over 60 years of engineering experience. Designed by Investors, for Investors: We are active investors always checking Stock, REITS, Mutual Funds, Crypto, and NFT prices. We were constantly watching the apps and the market, determining when to buy or sell. And it was so draining. We decided to design GLANCE and eliminate the need for constantly opening the apps while still staying up-to-date on the current market prices. Now we have the world of finance at a GLANCE.”

### Key Action Items:
After you understand the company’s vision, mission, and value proposition, please create a competitor analysis, and highlight the most relevant strengths and weaknesses. Identify GLANCE LED’s customer persona, and parse the social media channels to see if the content is tailored to their needs. Recommend marketing and a communication strategy with the best methods to raise brand awareness. Suggest partnerships and promotions.
Moreover, we ask you to help the company expand in the B2B segment. To achieve that, define the ideal B2B market, and prepare content and proper channels to approach them. Specify the B2B segment KPIs. Gather your ideas on paper or make a presentation, and present them to the company.
