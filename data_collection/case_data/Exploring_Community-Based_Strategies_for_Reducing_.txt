Title: Exploring Community-Based Strategies for Reducing Hate Crimes

Topics: Community Organization and Social Action, PR & Communications

### Background and Objective:
The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) has long been at the forefront of fighting hate, bigotry, and anti-Semitism across the United States. Despite ongoing efforts, hate crimes continue to rise in many communities, highlighting the urgent need for innovative, community-driven approaches to combat these issues. Communities are uniquely positioned to lead efforts to reduce hate crimes because they are directly impacted and often have a deep understanding of local dynamics.
This project invites students to propose community-based strategies for reducing hate crimes in local areas, focusing on creating programs, partnerships, and educational campaigns that can be implemented at the grassroots level. The goal is to explore how communities, when empowered with the right resources and support, can play an active role in fostering inclusivity, reducing hate, and ensuring safety for all.

### Key Action Items:
Students will focus on developing strategic, community-based solutions aimed at reducing hate crimes. The project will center on identifying actionable strategies, building local partnerships, and creating educational and awareness campaigns.
