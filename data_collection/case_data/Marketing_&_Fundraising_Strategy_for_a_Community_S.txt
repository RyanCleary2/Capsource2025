### Key Action Items:
CSA’s primary goal for this project is to develop fundraising and marketing campaigns and strategies to acquire donors and supporters. You are asked to understand what strategies are used in the nonprofit sector. What are the different donor types, and how can they be found? Create a competitor analysis, and reveal how other organizations communicate their concept and values to the stakeholders. Research and present best practices for fundraising strategies/tactics for similar organizations using social media channels. Provide a list of potential donors to target, and explain why they are the best fit for CSA. Finally, analyze the company’s marketing strategies and find the weakest points that should be developed. Conduct a presentation about the recommended marketing strategies, and explain why those are the best fit. Evaluate the current social media channels and their traffic and find the pain points, if there are any.
