Title: Marketing & Fundraising Strategy for a Community Service Agency

Topics: Marketing

### Background and Objective:
CSA’s primary goal for this project is to develop fundraising and marketing campaigns and strategies, mainly as they can acquire donors/supporters, general fundraising, and program-specific fundraising.  For marketing, the organization hopes to develop a more effective website and marketing campaign.  For fundraising, CSA would like to identify foundations or corporate donors to request donations and develop materials for donation solicitations.
CSA is a private, nonprofit Community Action Agency (CAA). For more than 50 years, CSA has been at the forefront of providing services to address the needs of the working poor and low-income residents of Washoe County and northern Nevada. Our service operations place us as one of the largest private human services agencies in northern Nevada, focusing on low-income and hard-to-serve clients.
CSA collaborates with a variety of partners, representing local, state, and federal governments, as well as community and advocacy groups, policymakers, and low-income leaders, to provide and administer a variety of federal, state, and local programs and services to improve the lives of an average of 4,000 low-income individuals/families (that earning between 0-200% of the Federal Poverty Level) annually in our community, through Early Childhood Education Programs (Early Head Start/Head Start), Workforce Development Programs, Income and Asset Building Services, Income Tax Preparation Program, Energy Programs, and Housing Services. In addition, CSA, through its development subsidiary, Community Services Agency Development Corporation, has developed 16 affordable and senior housing complexes over the past 20 years.

### Key Action Items:
CSA’s primary goal for this project is to develop fundraising and marketing campaigns and strategies to acquire donors and supporters. You are asked to understand what strategies are used in the nonprofit sector. What are the different donor types, and how can they be found? Create a competitor analysis, and reveal how other organizations communicate their concept and values to the stakeholders. Research and present best practices for fundraising strategies/tactics for similar organizations using social media channels. Provide a list of potential donors to target, and explain why they are the best fit for CSA. Finally, analyze the company’s marketing strategies and find the weakest points that should be developed. Conduct a presentation about the recommended marketing strategies, and explain why those are the best fit. Evaluate the current social media channels and their traffic and find the pain points, if there are any.
