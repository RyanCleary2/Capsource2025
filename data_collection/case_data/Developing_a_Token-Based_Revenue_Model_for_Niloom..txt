Title: Developing a Token-Based Revenue Model for Niloom.ai: Balancing Usage and Bandwidth Considerations

Topics: Data Management, Growth Strategy, Information Technology (IT), Market Research, Operations, Product Design & Development, Reporting, Financial Planning & Analysis, Sales & Business Development, Software Design & Development

### Background and Objective:
Niloom.ai
, an AI-powered platform, seeks to implement a
token-based revenue model
to optimize
monetization based on customer usage and bandwidth consumption
. The challenge lies in identifying the
most effective pricing mechanism
that balances:
Customer affordability and accessibility
– Ensuring the pricing model remains competitive while maximizing revenue.
Fair and scalable usage-based pricing
– Aligning token consumption with real-time usage and AI model processing requirements.
Industry-standard best practices
– Benchmarking against leading AI-powered SaaS platforms to determine optimal revenue structures.
Currently, AI-driven platforms employ various token-based revenue models, such as:
API Call-Based Pricing
– Charging tokens per request or per unit of processing.
Bandwidth Consumption-Based Pricing
– Charging based on the data bandwidth required for AI processing.
Hybrid Token Usage Models
– Combining various factors such as API calls, storage, and processing power.
This project challenges students to develop a
data-backed tokenized revenue model
that aligns with Niloom.ai’s
business objectives, infrastructure capabilities, and competitive positioning
in the AI space.

### Key Action Items:
Students will develop a
structured, research-backed revenue model proposal
, focusing on:
Industry Analysis & Competitive Benchmarking
– Identifying best practices from AI-driven SaaS platforms.
Customer Segmentation & Pricing Sensitivity
– Understanding how different customer tiers (small businesses vs. enterprise clients) would engage with a token-based system.
Technical & Operational Feasibility
– Assessing how a token system integrates with Niloom.ai’s backend, APIs, and existing billing systems.
Implementation Plan & Scalability Considerations
– Recommending a phased rollout strategy with customer adoption projections.
