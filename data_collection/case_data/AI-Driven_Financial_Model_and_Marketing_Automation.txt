Title: AI-Driven Financial Model and Marketing Automation for MFI Commercial

Topics: Data Management, Market Research, Operations, Product Design & Development, Research, Analysis, Evaluation, Software Design & Development

### Background and Objective:
MFI Commercial has established itself as a leader in mobile home and RV park real estate transactions, having successfully completed deals across 40 states. With its recent expansion into general commercial real estate, the company faces the challenge of scaling its financial underwriting and marketing processes to meet the growing demands of this larger and more diverse market.
Currently, these processes are time-consuming and require significant manual effort, particularly when inputting financial data, conducting underwriting, and generating marketing materials. The opportunity lies in leveraging AI and automation to streamline these workflows, making them faster, more accurate, and scalable. MFI Commercial aims to develop an AI-based financial model that automates the standardization of financial documents (such as profit and loss statements, rent rolls, and home inventory lists), reducing manual input and producing comprehensive financial analyses.
Simultaneously, the company seeks to automate the creation of marketing materials, integrating data from its CRM and listing platforms into a seamless system that can quickly generate offering memorandums, property summaries, and marketing content. This project will enable MFI to scale its operations, handle more complex deals, and create new revenue streams by potentially offering this AI-driven solution as a standalone product or service.

### Key Action Items:
Develop an AI-driven financial underwriting model that automates the processing and standardization of income and expense data.
Integrate AI to streamline the generation of proformas, disposition summaries, and key financial metrics (e.g., cap rate, IRR, cash-on-cash return).
Automate the creation of offering memorandums and marketing materials by pulling data from existing CRM and listing management tools.
Ensure compatibility of the system with existing tools like monday.com to facilitate marketing content generation.
Design templates for marketing materials that automatically include key property information, investment summaries, and other essential data points.
