Title: Strategic Proposal for Enhancing B2B Digital Lead & Revenue Generation for Baxters North America

Topics: Digital Marketing, Growth Strategy, Market Research, Marketing

### Background and Objective:
Baxters North America, a trusted brand within the food and beverage industry, has earned a reputation for high-quality products and services. With a legacy spanning decades, the company has grown into a major player, serving both retail consumers and B2B clients across multiple industries. However, as digital transformation reshapes industries worldwide, Baxters North America is facing an increasingly competitive B2B landscape.
In particular, the shift towards digital-first interactions presents both challenges and opportunities. While Baxters has built strong relationships through traditional channels, its current digital presence is not fully optimized to capture the growing wave of digital B2B interactions. The company’s website, LinkedIn page, and digital content lack the sophisticated engagement mechanisms that modern B2B clients expect. Moreover, search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing strategies have not been leveraged to their full potential, limiting Baxters’ ability to attract new clients and convert them into high-quality leads.
Baxters North America stands at a crossroads where it can capitalize on the power of digital strategies to not only increase traffic to its website but also convert that traffic into revenue-generating opportunities. The challenge is to enhance the company’s digital presence strategically by modernizing its online platforms, improving SEO, creating valuable B2B content, and developing targeted marketing campaigns.
The opportunity is immense. With the right digital strategies, Baxters can attract new B2B clients, deepen existing relationships, and position itself as a leader in the food and beverage industry’s digital transformation. This project invites students to propose strategic solutions to help Baxters modernize its digital presence, enhance B2B lead generation, and capitalize on untapped market opportunities.
Students will develop a strategic plan to enhance Baxters North America's digital presence and lead generation efforts. The focus is on proposing solutions, enabling students to develop business insights and apply practical knowledge in real-world scenarios. The proposals should include recommendations for improving website design, optimizing SEO, creating engaging content, and developing digital marketing strategies to target B2B clients.
