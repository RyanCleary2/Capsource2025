Title: Preparing for Tariffs: Navigating Production Shifts to China for Solé Bicycles

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility, Growth Strategy, Legal, Regulatory, Compliance, Market Research, Operations, Purchasing, Logistics, Supply Chain, Reporting, Financial Planning & Analysis

### Background and Objective:
As Solé Bicycles actively shifts its production to China to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies, the potential for new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration creates an urgent need to reassess strategy. Increased tariffs could significantly raise costs, impact pricing, and disrupt supply chains. To maintain profitability and competitive pricing, Solé must explore
ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs
while optimizing its supply chain and production strategy.
This project will allow students to explore strategies for managing the complexities of international production, understanding tariff implications, and developing actionable recommendations to help Solé navigate this challenging environment.

### Key Action Items:
Students will develop a comprehensive
risk mitigation strategy
for Solé Bicycles that focuses on handling the impact of tariffs on production, supply chain, and pricing. Key areas of focus include:
Tariff Impact Analysis
– Assess the financial and operational effects of tariffs on production costs and profitability.
Alternative Sourcing and Production Strategies
– Explore sourcing and manufacturing options to reduce reliance on China.
Pricing and Cost Management
– Develop strategies to manage increased costs without compromising market position.
Risk Management and Compliance
– Ensure Solé is prepared to navigate regulatory requirements and operational risks.
