Title: Postum’s Fork in the Road

Topics: Growth Strategy, Product Design & Development, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
ABSTRACT
Postum is a trademark and trade secret of Eliza's Quest Food, a North Carolina, U.S., LLC. First launched in 1895 as a non-caffeinated coffee alternative by Postum Cereal Company,  the formulation was created by C.W. Post and later sold to General Foods in 1929. In 2007, the brand was discontinued when Kraft acquired Postum from General Foods. Postum lovers responded with a "passionate campaign to bring back our Postum using online petitions, blogs, and websites to gain support. Their voices were heard" (Postum.com). In 2012, the coffee substitute, Postum, was purchased by Eliza's Quest Foods, owned by two long-time Postum users. Postum's modest suite of products includes an instant, powdered grain format in three flavors: original (roasted wheat bran, wheat, and molasses), coffee-flavored, and cocoa-flavored. The brand is marketed using the following claims: organic, fairly traded, vegan, kosher, all-natural, and fair traded. The product is offered in seven- and eight-ounce jars and can be consumed warm or chilled. Postum may have benefited early from first-mover status. However, it has declined in revenue from the latest available Nielsen measure, $6.6 million in 1995, to $900 thousand in  2016 (Buzzfile). Postum has since been flanked by a phalanx of large and small natural beverage competitors, non-caffeinated herbal teas, and the high-growth ready to drink (RTD) coffee market, promoting a myriad of better-for-you beverage options. Postum must make a  strategic decision. Should the company invest in Research and Development and launch new products and brands into a larger, growing, and more lucrative market or stay positioned in the coffee substitute market by taking the costs out of their value chain to become the low-cost provider?

INTRODUCTION
Eliza's Quest Food is a privately-held company with six employees. It is owned and managed by June Rust, President, and Dayle Rust, two long-time Postum users who grew up with the brand and appreciate the emotional connection Postum has with its loyal base. June Rust has a Master of Arts in Education from East Carolina University. A VP with a vast retail and food service sales background was recently hired. A 2,530-square-foot facility modernization has been completed in anticipation of growth due to approved applicant distribution of the points for new distribution points and favorable shelf placement. Since 2012, the management team at Eliza's Quest Foods has worked to develop packaging, warehousing, and shipping, as well as directly selling/distributing Postum to distribution companies, individual grocery stores, and health food stores, managing online sales to individual consumers. In 2017, Postum leadership worked with Long Island University Post and LIU IQ Consulting's student consulting team to develop a marketing plan. LIU IQ promotes advancing business knowledge and judgment among preeminent students, companies, and universities. The students benefit from exposure to professional business cases. Companies benefit from divergent thinking, dynamic problem solving, and an opportunity for new talent hiring. The final presentation from the team of students was well received by Postum leadership; it included recommendations for further distribution, a new product, packaging and labeling, marketing, advertising, and social media.
THE COFFEE SUBSTITUTE MARKET
The coffee substitute market was $7.5 million in 1995 (Elliot, 1995). Nielsen further reported that Postum had a significant 87.7% share of the coffee substitute market 52 weeks ending 12/10/1995. The advertising agency, Foote Cone Belding/Leber Katz Partners, General Foods/Kraft agency of record, was charged with creating the Postum comeback campaign delivering print, radio, recipes, and coupons to targeted consumers 55+ using the "truly soothing hot beverage" campaign. The year-long campaign reportedly represented $984 thousand (Elliott, 1995).
The competitive set in the coffee substitute market consists of Postum, Capomo,  Ayurvedic Roast, Roma, Cafix, Pero, Beyond Coffee, Inka, and Teeccino, as ranked on AAmazon.com's"The 10 Best Coffee Substitutes" (Dvoretz, 2017).
THE INSTANT COFFEE MARKET
A growth market to examine is instant coffee. Postum fits into the instant coffee arena because it can be served instantly and is agglomerated. According to Globe Newswire (2017): "Instant coffee has gained significant popularity among consumers due to its convenience in terms of time and preparation. The easy availability of instant coffee across various channels and its lower price versus ground coffee have contributed to its rising popularity. The CAGR for instant coffee is projected at 4.8% ($28 billion in  2016 and $43 Billion by the end of 2025. (as indicated in Table 1) Postum's product is in  the agglomerated (instant) form and can well tap into the market attribute of convenience." However, Postum has no cost advantage compared to the best-selling brands. (as indicated in Table 2)
THE READY TO DRINK (RTD) MARKET
The RTD segment grew by +6.5% from 2014-2015 (Beverage Marketing Group, 2016). Mintel estimates that the segment will continue to grow through 2020. (2017) (as indicated in  Table 3). There is trending market potential in the beverage category within the younger demographic as they prefer the RTD segment of the industry. Prominent beverage manufacturers/marketers are competing in the RTD market bolstered by the twin trends of on-the-go, health, and wellness. In contrast, the caffeinated market remains large and tends to attract the older demographic. (as indicated in Table 4) According to a 2016 US IbisWorld Beverage Study, age is an essential factor in consumers' choice of caffeinated beverage. The youngest consumers (under 18) cited carbonated soft drinks and tea as providing greater caffeine, whereas the oldest consumers (50-64) preferred coffee. (as indicated in Table 5) The CEO of PepsiCo, who organized a better-for-you segment of competitive entries for her company, stated that soft drinks are a "thing of the past" and that RTD bottled tea will be a sales driver for the company in the future (Berry, 2016).
Both large and small beverage manufacturers are responding to the better-for-you and  RTD market potential with products and packaging that meet consumers' demands by communicating stories of purpose, ingredients, and function (Berry, 2016). Claims include natural ingredients, no artificial colors or flavors, no sugar, vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber,  antioxidants, plant extracts, prebiotics, and probiotics. Non-GMO consumers recognize the value of buying products that are not potentially unstable to the food supply. Non-GMO sales exceeded $10 billion last year. (as indicated in Table 6) According to Mintel (2016), when purchasing nutritional and performance drinks, the most critical factors for U.S. consumers are favorite flavor (41%), amount of protein (40%), and high fiber (33%).
New entrants are touting artisanal brews, indulgent flavors, better-for-you formulations, cold brew technology, energy inducement, herb and vitamin enrichments, and no or low sugar (Food Beverage News, 2018). Based on the total rush to fragmentation and a now crowded segment, consumers may begin to take on a high engagement/high abandonment mentality. A projectable segmentation study of the RTD and functional beverage segments may lead manufacturers to their most profitable opportunities.
MARKETING TO CONSUMERS
Postum attempts to engage current consumers using a nostalgic platform with copy harkening the reader back in time: "Postum. The Hot Beverage with Warm Memories," "Rich  Tradition," "A Stroll Down Memory Lane," "#WholesomePostum," and photography from years past. The emotional benefit appears as one of sentimental longing and happy associations. The brand name and old-fashioned label work to preserve this emotional tie and to allow connection to those loyal to the brand years past. The functional benefit appears to be twofold:  wholesomeness and a contrast to the experience of coffee jitters. There is a nominal following on  Postum social channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest), perhaps suggesting that an older demographic does not consume social media.
PRICING
If the leadership of Postum desires future revenue growth, the question is, what is their path to the future: New markets? New brands? New target age groups? Product development? New alliances and distribution (K-cups)? New imagery, including brand influencers? The challenge is to investigate what consumers value in a non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic, warm, or cold beverage or develop a new brand that better resonates with younger consumers.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
Postum's dedication and investment in R&D must be significant if it decides on a  differentiation strategy to broaden its line. If, on the other hand, it opts to compete in its current product and packaging in the coffee substitute market, it may become obsolete.

### Key Action Items:
After reading and understanding the case, conduct an internal and external scan. Decide which strategy the company should employ to position itself for growth best. Low-cost provider-striving to achieve lower overall costs than rivals on products to attract a broad or niche spectrum of consumers. Prepare a differentiation strategy for the development and devise methods to attract a new range of consumers. Should Postum remain in the coffee-substitute sector and appeal to its consumers (55+) using its legacy of “memories”? If so, how can they improve the marketing strategy? Or should the company appeal to new consumer tastes? If so, which direction should the brand take to be best positioned in the market moving forward? 1., Organize a brainstorming session: Analyze growth/size opportunity, competitive environment, consumer trends, and behavior for the overall market. Regarding the company, prepare branding strategy, marketing strategy, target segment,  geographic coverage, production capabilities, distribution channels, and product characteristics (flavors, labels, packaging). 2., Build an issue tree: After all the ideas from the brainstorming section have been collected, organize key issues in an Issue Tree. Using each of the three assigned questions in the case, the branches should represent areas to be researched, starting from the significant question and branching down into individual issues. Address the MECE rule when identifying branches (points) of the project. Each branch should be mutually exclusive, with no overlaps, and Collectively Exhaustive,  leaving no gaps in the analysis.
