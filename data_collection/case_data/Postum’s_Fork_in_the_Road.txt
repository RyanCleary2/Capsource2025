After reading and understanding the case, conduct an internal and external scan. Decide which strategy the company should employ to position itself for growth best. Low-cost provider-striving to achieve lower overall costs than rivals on products to attract a broad or niche spectrum of consumers. Prepare a differentiation strategy for the development and devise methods to attract a new range of consumers. Should Postum remain in the coffee-substitute sector and appeal to its consumers (55+) using its legacy of “memories”? If so, how can they improve the marketing strategy? Or should the company appeal to new consumer tastes? If so, which direction should the brand take to be best positioned in the market moving forward? 1., Organize a brainstorming session: Analyze growth/size opportunity, competitive environment, consumer trends, and behavior for the overall market. Regarding the company, prepare branding strategy, marketing strategy, target segment,  geographic coverage, production capabilities, distribution channels, and product characteristics (flavors, labels, packaging). 2., Build an issue tree: After all the ideas from the brainstorming section have been collected, organize key issues in an Issue Tree. Using each of the three assigned questions in the case, the branches should represent areas to be researched, starting from the significant question and branching down into individual issues. Address the MECE rule when identifying branches (points) of the project. Each branch should be mutually exclusive, with no overlaps, and Collectively Exhaustive,  leaving no gaps in the analysis.
