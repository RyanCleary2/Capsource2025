Title: Developing a Local Growth Strategy for ArmorPoxy

Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing

### Background and Objective:
ArmorPoxy, a leading manufacturer of commercial epoxy flooring and interlocking floor tiles, is expanding its operations to strengthen its local business. The company recently moved into a new 13,000-square-foot facility and established a distribution partnership with Lowe’s. However, with 30% of its sales coming from online business, the focus now is on increasing in-store sales and capturing a larger share of the local market.
The challenge is to build stronger connections with contractors, floor installers, and other industry professionals who can integrate ArmorPoxy’s products into their service offerings. ArmorPoxy aims to identify opportunities for growth by enhancing its marketing strategies, expanding local partnerships, and improving its product catalog to boost local sales.
This project invites students to develop a strategic local growth plan, focusing on market research, product portfolio improvements, and actionable marketing tactics.

### Key Action Items:
