### Background and Objective:

### Key Action Items:
Canal Commons is a public housing complex that consists of four apartment buildings. Over the last several years there has been some growing concern about increased drug use and violence in the Carrie Meek community. Residents of the community blame Canal Commons for the uptick in drugs and violence. However, when police reports were reviewed - most of the violence and drugs were being brought in from outsiders coming into the Carrie Meek community…not the Canal Commons complex.
Still the neighborhood Canal Commons is located in is not a safe place to live by any means. There is a high level of police surveillance. Outside of Dollar General, there is nowhere to shop. The closest grocery store is not easily accessible because it requires transferring buses and takes over an hour to reach. There are only a few employers in the immediate vicinity. Without a car it is very difficult to secure and maintain a job.
The manager of the Canal Commons is Laurin, a Latina woman in her fifties. She grew up in the Meek neighborhood, attended the local university where she earned her bachelors of social work (BSW). She has always worked in the community and is a great asset to Canal Commons. She has been in charge of managing the housing complex for over 12 years. She lives onsite with her husband, Jorge, who works at a local bottling plant. She prides herself on knowing almost all of the residents by name, including the children. This means a lot to the residents who often feel like a number in the system. They like Laurin and they trust her, which says a lot.
Years ago, when she first started, Laurin created a Community Council that included residents from all four buildings. The hope was to create a sense of community and increase activism. Laurin consistently works closely with local non-profits and a community police officer to address issues before they become larger community wide problems. She is well aware that many of the families in the complex have many challenges including, but not limited to financial need, mental health, and affordable daycare. Laurin is well-versed in the local service available and works to maintain strong contacts with individuals working for local agencies. She is always available to make referrals as needed, but  also tries to help problem-solve by listening to residents and working through possible solutions.
Scenario A:
Canal Commons and Meek neighborhood create a task force to collaborate on mutual goals, possible funding, and issues impacting their community.
Scenario B:
Canal Commons Community Council contacts the local government about the need for maintenance and repairs at the housing complex. They also apply for funding and support from additional entities, e.g. philanthropy organizations, educational institutions, etc.
Scenario C:
Meek neighborhood holds an open forum about Canal Commons and the need for the public housing complex to be torn down/removed from the community. It brings in public officials who support this initiative. The forum also includes financial advisors that show a positive fiscal impact to the neighborhood if the complex is removed and a revitalization area is created.
