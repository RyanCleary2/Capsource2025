Title: The Case of Sarah Jacobs

Topics: Case Management, Individual and Family Advocacy, Public Administration

### Background and Objective:
Sarah Jacobs is a 45-year-old Caucasian female referred to case management services by a child protection investigator (CPI) following concerns about Sarah’s mental health and the impact this is having on her two young kids. Sarah has been married to her husband Jordan for nine years, and they have two children together: Mia, daughter, age eight, and Stephen, son, age five. Sarah is a stay-at-home mom. She does not work outside the home. She has been receiving supplemental security income (SSI) for the past ten years following her mental health diagnosis. Sarah was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 1 four years ago, and about ten years ago, she was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), severe, with suicidal ideations. Over the last several months, she has noticed similar behaviors in both of her children. This is triggering and, at times, causes her to avoid engaging with her children.

### Key Action Items:
Main/Current Event
: About two months ago, child protective services (CPS) investigated an allegation from the children’s school that the kids were consistently showing up to school unbathed and dirty. The CPI determined that the children’s hygienic needs were sometimes neglected due to the severity of Sarah’s mental health problems. Because Sarah’s husband worked overtime for the postal service, he was often not home and unable to help his wife take care of the kids. Last week, when the CPI did an unannounced home visit in the evening the children were found locked outside the house. After knocking for several minutes, Sarah came to the door stating that she did not realize that the door was locked. She had fallen asleep after taking her medication. Sarah’s husband, Jordan, was still at work.
Sarah had been treated with a variety of psychotropic medications since her initial psychiatric diagnosis about ten years ago. While Sarah’s medications for MDD and Bipolar Disorder help with her symptoms, they also produce side effects that increase drowsiness and reduce cognitive reasoning. Because of these undesired side effects from her medications, it is unclear whether Sarah’s difficulties attending to her children’s activities of daily living is a function of her mental health (MH) difficulties and/or being prescribed multiple medications at the same time (i.e., polypharmacy)Sarah’s current medication list includes the following:
Major Depressive Disorder: Anxiolytic, which may relieve anxiety and tension. It often causes drowsiness and promotes sleep
Sertraline, commonly known as Zoloft, is an antidepressant that belongs to a group of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Bipolar 1:Amitriptyline, which can cause Impairments in verbal-numerical reasoning and Impairments in memory
Divalproex sodium (Depakote) is a mood stabilizer
Scenario A:
During the unannounced home visit, the CPI observed that Sarah seemed drowsy and confused, and had difficulty formulating and expressing her thoughts. The CPI saw no evidence of illicit drug or alcohol use, and, when asked by the investigator, Sarah reported she did not use illegal drugs and had not used alcohol that day. The only drugs she'd taken were those prescribed by her doctor, and she had taken them as directed.
Scenario B:
Upon realizing the severity of the situation, Jordan confesses he is unable to assist Sarah any longer. He is exhausted from working long hours, Sarah’s medical bills and prescription co-pays, as well as, a basic fear of something happening to the children while he is at work. He petitions the court for full custody and for Sarah to be removed from the home.
Scenario C:
Mia’s classmates have begun ostracizing her based on her dirty clothes. She has tried to wash her clothes in the sink as well as bathe herself, but she is often busy watching her brother and making sure he eats. Mia has become more and more withdrawn in school. One day after school she goes home to find her mother asleep again. She goes into her mother’s bathroom and feeling worn down/tired she takes several of Sarah’s ‘vitamins’.
