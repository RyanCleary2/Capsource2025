Title: Raising Brand Awareness for a Pet Accessories Company that Gives Back

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility, Marketing

### Background and Objective:
Pack Leashes knows that global consumers are looking to purchase goods from companies that serve as a partner in addressing social and environmental issues. Research has shown that about “90% of global consumers are likely to switch brands to one associated with a good cause, given comparable price and quality.” (Cone Communications/Echo Global CSR Study,
2015
) Pack Leashes currently has an established brand on social media and is looking to create marketing tools that help increase brand exposure and awareness.
Pack Leashes wants to create marketing content for the coming holiday season that increases exposure and awareness for the company and its cause to feed as many dogs as possible. The company wants you to develop a press release for
GivingTuesday
, a global movement that inspires millions of people to give, collaborate, and celebrate generosity.  Pack Leashes plans to distribute a press release through multiple social media channels (email, website, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and asks for your help creating a communication campaign and renewing its marketing strategy to create brand awareness and attract more customers.
About the brand: Pack Leashes is a brand that stands at the crossroads of durability and fashion. Pack Leashes makes bow tie collars and reversible harnesses with matching leashes for dogs to express their fashionable side. Pack Leashes also has climbing rope leashes that come with a carabiner. The rope leashes are super sturdy and ready for adventure. The Pack Leashes brand extends beyond the products they sell. Pack Leashes donates 2 pounds of dog food for every sale made to shelters in need. Pack Leashes has donated over 200,000 meals for dogs and counting every day. Pack is a huge believer in giving back and providing a grade-A product simultaneously. Pack Leashes doesn't plan on stopping the donations any time soon and hopes to reach 1,000,000 pounds soon.

### Key Action Items:
Understand the company’s vision, mission, and business model. What do customers say about the company and its products and services? What’s the brand reputation? Who are the competitors? What would you say about Pack Leashes’ position in the industry? As the company wants to give a press release for Giving Tuesday, you are asked to help create content and define the best social media channels to reach customers. We also want you to create a brand video that tells the story of Pack Leashes and raises awareness about the brand. Finally, develop a social media communication calendar with all the important events the company should prepare for and suggest content and communication strategy for each.
