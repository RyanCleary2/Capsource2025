### Key Action Items:
Understand the company’s vision, mission, and business model. What do customers say about the company and its products and services? What’s the brand reputation? Who are the competitors? What would you say about Pack Leashes’ position in the industry? As the company wants to give a press release for Giving Tuesday, you are asked to help create content and define the best social media channels to reach customers. We also want you to create a brand video that tells the story of Pack Leashes and raises awareness about the brand. Finally, develop a social media communication calendar with all the important events the company should prepare for and suggest content and communication strategy for each.
