Title: Conduct a Target Audience Analysis and Suggest a Sales Campaign to Create Conversions

Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing, Sales & Business Development, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
We wish to increase our revenue & margin in our Mexico operation by identifying new business opportunities, better and more efficient business models (e.g., recurring revenue), and additional revenue streams based on our core capabilities and assets.
About the company: Tycoon is an expert in IP and Trademark Licensing. We obtain rights from Brand owners to represent their interests. At the same time, we license their IP to third parties, whether Retailers, third-party distributors, or Manufacturers, to transform such IP into new consumer products and experiences. We are well recognized Internationally in the Licensing field, whether IP comes from the Entertainment, Corporate, or Lifestyle sectors, and can reach almost any Brand Owner. Our company currently represents a wide roaster of BRANDS of global relevance (Please see the PDF attached). We have relationships with the biggest producers and media platforms and knowledge about upcoming releases ahead of time. Our operations work across Latin America via eight offices on the ground and native professionals and industry experts.
What we need help with: Representing strong brands without ownership. We are a middleman that can quickly jumpstart a Licensed business for a new Brand, but that can be easily turned off at any time. Representation terms and conditions are standardized globally with little room for improvement (pushing the envelope only at risk of losing the deal). The length of the terms is typically three years, hardly longer, and renewal is never guaranteed. Commission rates have dropped in the last few years, and our company lost its most significant accounts (i.e., MARVEL, UNIVERSAL, FOX, MGAE, and ZAG). As a result, our business in MEXICO has become less and less profitable. And while we represent "Majors" in other territories, we compete against them in Mexico with far fewer resources. To offset this effect, TYCOON MEXICO has turned to Lifestyle and Corporate Brands and has found good opportunities. However, the phenomenon described above is bound to repeat itself in this sector too. Large Brand Owners want to run their businesses themselves rather than through an Agent.
TYCOON MEXICO needs to re-engineer its operation to streamline costs and refocus its efforts toward more profitable activities that take advantage of its many assets. This is the challenge.

### Key Action Items:
Gain familiarity with the company and its activities. What are Tycoon’s vision, mission, and long-term goals? What is their value proposition? Create a customer persona. How can the company give value to them? You are asked to compile a competitor and a SWOT analysis to explore Tycoon’s strengths and weaknesses in its industry. Finally, you must propose a campaign (sales, marketing, and communication) to grow the company. Pay close attention to the financial plan and determine KPIs. Why do you think your recommended strategy is the most effective?
