### Key Action Items:
Stella is an only child. She is mature, emotionally intelligent, involved in sports and music, and has earned A's in all her classes. Stella’s parents, Jonathan and Nancy, own and operate their own business. Stella is their highest priority. They are involved in all of her activities. At least one parent attends every game and school music event, if not both. Stella was invited last month to join the city All-Star, soccer team.
Stella has started a menstrual cycle and has cramps and moodiness. Nancy, after a consultation with her local Vietnamese community leaders, began using cupping which is a common traditional Eastern medicine.
Stella’s school soccer coach, Tracey Richards, saw the bruises at soccer practice and later met with her to discuss them.
Scenario A:
Bruising is from cupping an alternative therapy. Stella has begun her menstrual cycle. Her parents state she has been irritable and suffers from cramps.
Scenario B:
Bruising is from soccer. Coach Richards is unaware that Stella was invited to play for the All-Star city team. Stella has not shared the news because she thinks the coach will doubt her dedication to the school team. Stella is the youngest member and smallest member of the All-City team. Last week she collided with other players trying to secure the ball several times. This led to bruising on her arms.
Scenario C:
Bruising is from a possible vitamin deficiency from a possible eating disorder. As Stella becomes more aware of Western beauty standards, her classmates' opinions, and her own body she feels pressure to assimilate and to be ‘beautiful’ by Western standards. Her parents leave to open their business after they help Stella get ready for school. Stella has started wrapping her breakfast in napkins and throwing it away. She buys lunch, but often only appears to eat to not draw attention. After two hours of soccer practice or a game - she does eat dinner with her parents. Between her cycle, sports, and growing/developing she is simply not eating enough and definitely not getting the vitamins and minerals her body needs.
