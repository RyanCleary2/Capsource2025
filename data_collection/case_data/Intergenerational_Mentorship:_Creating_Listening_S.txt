Topics: Community Organization and Social Action, Facilitation, Mediation, Conflict Resolution, Individual and Family Advocacy, Organizational Culture, Public Administration

### Background and Objective:
Handmaker Jewish Services for Aging is a senior living and care facility that values
community, dignity, and meaningful engagement
. Many residents have
rich life experiences and wisdom
, yet often face
loneliness and a lack of intergenerational connection
. Meanwhile, younger generations—children, adolescents, and young professionals—are navigating
life transitions, personal development, and career challenges
.
This project presents an opportunity to
develop an intergenerational mentoring program
at Handmaker, where
youth and elders
engage in
structured listening sessions
to foster
mutual learning and relationship-building
. Through these
mentorship-style conversations
, young participants will gain
valuable insights from the elders' experiences
, while the elders will find
purpose and engagement
by sharing their knowledge and stories.
The goal is to
design a scalable, well-structured mentorship framework
that promotes
active listening, personal growth, and community connections
, enhancing the well-being of all participants.
