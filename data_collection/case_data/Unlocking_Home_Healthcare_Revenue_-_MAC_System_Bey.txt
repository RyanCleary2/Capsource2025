Title: Unlocking Home Healthcare Revenue - MAC System Beyond Hospitals

Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
RF Health is a pioneering company dedicated to transforming healthcare through cutting-edge technology, improving patient care and quality of life. The company has developed the MAC System—a revolutionary medical device cleared by the FDA for hospital and at-home use. Their mission is to extend the reach of the MAC System beyond hospital settings to empower patients and caregivers in their homes. This endeavor presents a complex and exciting challenge for the company. The central question is how to tap into the substantial revenue potential of the at-home market while navigating the landscape of reimbursement and product acquisition post-hospital stay.

### Key Action Items:
Reimbursement Landscape Understanding
: A thorough comprehension of the reimbursement landscape is essential. This includes the process of acquiring our reimbursement code from CMS. In-depth research is critical to determining the timing, duration, cost, and anticipated reimbursement rates, which are vital factors for establishing the financial model for the at-home market.
Rent vs. Buy Decision
: Whether to rent or sell our device is another crucial consideration. If obtaining reimbursement or reimbursement amounts is minimal, alternative strategies for capitalizing on the at-home market must be explored. One approach could involve renting the device's capital component while billing only for the consumable straps. However, it's imperative to ensure that costs are adequately covered and a favorable margin is maintained to justify the overhead expenses associated with maintaining such a program, which includes shipping, disinfecting, reprocessing, repacking, and billing. Additionally, strategies for capital retrieval and hardware loss minimization need to be devised.
Utilization Monitoring via App Connectivity
: Exploring the possibility of connecting our at-home device to an app for real-time monitoring of patient utilization and wear-time is essential. This data can potentially instill confidence among insurance companies, leading to improved reimbursement, similar to the way C-PAP machines are handled. Demonstrating that our device is being actively used can address the concerns of insurance providers who are reluctant to pay for products with low utilization rates. Research validation is required to substantiate this utilization model further.
These items form the foundation of our strategy to navigate the complex challenges associated with expanding our MAC System into the at-home market successfully.
