Title: Optimizing HVAC Systems with Machine Learning Frameworks

Topics: Data Management

### Background and Objective:
Your mission is to enhance our Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) platform by integrating machine learning (ML) capabilities, particularly concerning HVAC systems. This project will see you collaborate closely with faculty mentors and Eco-Enterprise leadership to explore data analysis techniques tailored for ML applications. To kick things off, your initial task is to dive into the insights gathered from our previous summer project. Following that, you'll engage in the process of reviewing and refining the data to determine its suitability for an ML framework. The final leg of your journey will involve conducting in-depth research into ML techniques customized to our dataset to achieve our project's goals. Our collective aim is to empower Eco-Enterprise with ML technology that optimizes the efficiency of HVAC systems, which are renowned for their costly and resource-intensive operation.

### Key Action Items:
