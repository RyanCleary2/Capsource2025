Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing, Research & Development, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
Founded in 2017, CapSource Technologies (formerly CapSource Education) is a high-growth start-up education technology company focused on helping schools build and scale their immersive, transformative project-based experiential learning programs that integrate real companies, their business leaders, and their challenges directly into the education process for their students.
CapSource’s
industry-integrated experiential learning platform
bridges academic and industry settings by strategically bringing learners, educators, and industry partners to collaborate on real-world business challenges.
CapSource CONNECT
is an experiential learning management system (E-LMS) that empowers educators and institutions' key industry partners to build, manage, and scale the kind of industry-based learning experiences that produce growth for engaged learners. A premium platform gives administrators the ability to customize certain elements of the platform, including branding, styles, learning programs and resources, topics, and templates.
CapSource offers a range of experiential educational products through its platform and serves private and public institutions and organizations of all sizes across the United States and internationally. And while the institutional and social need for Capsource’s products has been validated, the company needs to better identify just who its ideal customer is in the world of higher education and how it can better meet those customers’ needs and demonstrate value to its target audience.
At this stage of growth, the company is looking for help developing a more robust monetizing strategy and re-assessing its ideal customer to scale the company. CapSource needs help researching pricing models for similar experiential learning companies and career center technologies.

### Key Action Items:
Be familiar with the company’s vision, mission, and value proposition; we would like you to define the target audience for Capsource’s next growth stage and how they can effectively reach them. What are the tools and strategies you would recommend, and why? What are the most productive approaches in e-commerce that they should apply? Create a competitor analysis to explore the company’s position in the market and prepare a pricing strategy for its services.
