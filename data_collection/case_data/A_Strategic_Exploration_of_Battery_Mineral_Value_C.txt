Title: A Strategic Exploration of Battery Mineral Value Chains for Sustainable Innovation

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility, Growth Strategy, Product Design & Development, Purchasing, Logistics, Supply Chain

### Background and Objective:
Gain insights into the value chain of top battery minerals. Caterpillar's clients increasingly demand products which satisfy environmental factors, in additional to traditional productivity and cost factors, to align with those customers' Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives. As noted in Caterpillar's Investor Day 2022 presentation, Caterpillar is actively working to adapt to these changing demands. One initiative related to this adapation is expanding knowledge about key inputs to battery development as compared to its history with internal combustion engines.The primary objective is to improve the knowledge of company leaders in the Resource Industries (mining) segment regarding the value chain for battery minerals. By doing so, we aim to improve their understanding in support better decision-making in development and implementation of future products to meet customers' needs.

### Key Action Items:
Research Battery Types and Chemistries
: Conduct thorough research on various types of batteries and their respective chemistries. Understand the minerals required to produce these batteries considering their varying compositions and characteristics.
Identify Key Customers and Mining Processes
: Identify and analyze the key customers involved in mining the essential minerals for battery production. Explore their mining processes and understand the geographical locations of these mining operations.
Examine the Value Chain
: Delve into the value chain for each critical mineral used in battery production. Follow the entire journey of these minerals, from extraction at the mines to the final stages of battery development.
Analyze Opportunities and Challenges
: Thoroughly investigate the key opportunities within each value chain, such as potential growth areas, innovations, and market developments. Additionally, identify and assess the challenges faced at different stages of the value chains, including supply chain constraints and environmental impacts.
Summarize Findings for Leadership
: Prepare concise and executive-level material summarizing all the research findings. This material should effectively communicate the insights gained, enabling Caterpillar's Resource Industries (mining) segment leaders to improve their decision-making in development and implementation of future products to meet customers' needs.
