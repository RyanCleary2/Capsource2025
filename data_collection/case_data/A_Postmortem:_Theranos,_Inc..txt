Title: A Postmortem: Theranos, Inc.

Topics: Legal, Regulatory, Compliance

### Background and Objective:
In 2003, 19-year-old Stanford University dropout Elizabeth Holmes founded biotech Theranos Inc. Holmes brazenly claimed to have developed proprietary technologies that would disrupt the blood-testing industry. One technology eliminated the need to collect blood samples through traditional needles, instead using a finger stick that collected tiny amounts of blood into a small tube called a nanotainer. Another technology was a laboratory device named Edison that was able to run dozens of tests on the same, minute amount of blood, testing a gamut of fatal diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Theranos promised that its blood- tests would be faster, cheaper, and more accurate than traditional tests offered in labs, clinics, and hospitals.1 The media hype over the startup earned Theranos the vaunted unicorn status. However, by 2015, various media outlets exposed Theranos for perpetrating Silicon Valley’s biggest fraud. In 2018, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against Elizabeth Holmes and the company’s former No. 2 executive Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani for defrauding investors, doctors, and patients. In the wake of the high-profile scandal, the company began the formal process of dissolution. The case involves multiple stakeholders and raises economic, legal, and ethical issues worthy of consideration.
Theranos launched a series of successful funding rounds, backed by luminary venture capitalists Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, and Carlos Slim. Mega-deals with Walgreens, Pfizer, and the Department of Defense (DoD) whet the appetites of new investors and fueled additional funding. In 2014, Theranos reached a valuation of $9 billion with Holmes retaining 50% of the privately held company. Holmes had a net worth estimated at $4.5 billion, making her the youngest female self-made billionaire. A blue-chip board of directors was established, which included former Secretary of State George Shultz, former Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, and Senator Sam Nunn, just to name a few. By 2015, reports surfaced that Holmes and Balwani had lied to doctors and patients about test results and deceived investors about the company’s financial position. What ensued was a complete unraveling of the company and financial implosion. The company formally dissolved and sought to pay unsecured creditors its remaining cash, estimated at roughly $5 million. All told, Theranos investors lost nearly $1 billion, and  Holmes’s net worth dropped to virtually nothing.2 In June 2018, the Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Holmes and Balwani with nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, stemming from allegations that the two engaged in a scheme to defraud investors and a separate scam to defraud doctors and patients. Both Balwani and Holmes have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The DoJ said at the time that Holmes and Balwani could face up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and restitution costs, for each count on which they're convicted.3 However, recently a federal judge ruled that Holmes and Balwani would have their fraud case narrowed, but not dismissed. The judge ruled that prosecutors couldn’t pursue charges that relied on claims that Holmes and Balwani defrauded doctors and customers who didn’t pay for the company’s blood-tests. The judge said the indictment “failed to connect a specific intent to defraud” non-paying patients because prosecutors didn’t show how Holmes and Balwani intended to swindle them out of money or property. For similar reasons, the judge said, prosecutors couldn’t pursue charges based on doctors as victims. Nonetheless, while the ruling narrows the case, it leaves intact the lion’s share of charges that investors were defrauded. In short, prosecutors can still pursue charges that Holmes and Balwani bilked paying patients into relying on technology that they knew was faulty and placed some of those people in peril by providing false lab results. 4 If one wanted to give Holmes the benefit of doubt, then they would argue Holmes was an entrepreneurial founder, innovator, and visionary. As an entrepreneur, Holmes was swimming against enormous skepticism of what all-too-many deemed as impossible, not unlike entrepreneurs before her including Thomas Edison. Holmes was dismissed for having no medical or scientific training, yet credentials are not a necessary requirement for innovation. Innovators like Holmes often risk everything, daring to improve our living standards and make the world a better place. Theranos sought to differentiate itself through a more pain-free extraction of blood that would not require the needles that strike fear in so many. In finished form, the company’s technologies would facilitate rapid analysis of a small amount of blood on the way to more patient-specific drug regimens, early disease detection, and vastly greater peace of mind. With blood testing happening with great speed and at lower costs minus the horror of big needles, more and more patients would have the means and eagerness to test themselves with great regularity. Ultimately, Holmes was a visionary who believed deeply in technology that would eventually help save many lives, and that still may.5 Critics of Holmes would argue a very different account and cite secrecy, lies, and a toxic culture at Theranos. Simply put, the technology didn’t work properly and produced inaccurate results, even though the company publicly claimed that it could perform hundreds of tests and began deploying it in Walgreens stores. In reality, the company was secretly running its tests on commercial machines produced by Siemens and diluting blood samples to make it work. Holmes lied to investors by faking data, orchestrating results, and grossly overestimating its annual revenue forecasts. Holmes established a company culture of stifling dissent through intimidation and fear. When employees did raise concerns, they were typically fired on the spot. Theranos would then aggressively pursue lawsuits against ex-employees. Employees that remained at the company were typically forced to sign “airtight” non-disclosure agreements. While Holmes’ vision for a better blood test was legitimate and the cause noble, she crossed a line when she began to grossly misrepresent what she had achieved in her efforts to raise the support she needed.6 This case was written by Dr. Paul Melendez, Department of Management and Organizations, The University of Arizona.

### Key Action Items:
To understand this case, you are first asked to do background research: it's crucial to have a solid understanding of the company's history and business model. Research the company's founding, leadership team, technology, and fundraising efforts. Examine the claims: One of the key aspects of the Theranos case was the company's claims about its technology. It would be important to analyze these claims, evaluate their scientific validity, and consider how the company marketed its technology to investors and customers. Investigate the fraud allegations: Theranos faced numerous allegations of fraud and deceptive practices. Examine these allegations and review the evidence presented against the company. Analyze the regulatory oversight: Theranos operated in a highly regulated industry, and the case raises questions about the effectiveness of regulatory oversight. Explore the role of the FDA and other regulatory bodies in overseeing the company, and consider whether there were any gaps in the regulatory framework. The Theranos case also raises ethical concerns about the responsibilities of companies to their investors, customers, and the public. What are the ethical implications of Theranos's actions? Finally, examine the legal consequences faced by the company and its leadership.
