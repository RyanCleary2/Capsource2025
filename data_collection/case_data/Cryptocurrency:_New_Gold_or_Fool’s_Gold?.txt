Title: Cryptocurrency: New Gold or Fool’s Gold?

Topics: Data Management

### Background and Objective:
On Oct. 31, 2008, a white paper penned by a person using the alias “Satoshi Nakamoto” described a new system of electronic cash called Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is the name given to a broad group of digital assets which are not issued, regulated, or backed by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens used to transfer online payments directly from one party to another without using an intermediary entity. Underpinning cryptocurrencies is an open-access ledger referred to as the blockchain. When a cryptocurrency owner transfers a digital token to another party, the transaction is posted to the blockchain and assigned a unique string of numbers and letters. The distributed software networks that cryptocurrencies operate on can be downloaded by anyone. Miners, the people who run these programs, verify transactions by running the numbers through formulas on high-powered computers. These miners compete with others to batch together a block of transactions. The first block to be recognized by the network earns the winning computer a batch of newly minted bitcoins. This competition provides an incentive for miners to maintain the network and a mechanism through which new bitcoins are created.1 Cryptocurrency has stirred up considerable hype. While detractors have described cryptocurrency as a Ponzi scheme, others remain sanguine it will become the world’s currency reserve, advocates believe it is the new gold. The case involves multiple stakeholders and raises economic, legal, and ethical issues worthy of consideration.
While there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, only a handful have any appreciable size and potential future (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether respectively). The total market
capitalization of the global cryptocurrency market is now back at the $1.1 trillion level. Nonetheless, the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap is still down sharply from its peak value of nearly $3 trillion in 2021.2 Recent small surges notwithstanding, the cryptocurrency market is stuck in the doldrums. Some experts have suggested that cryptocurrency prices could fall even further before any sustained recovery. Though still in its infancy, the industry is constantly evolving with new entrants of cryptocurrencies, exchanges, lending platforms, dealer-brokers, and Web3. This largely explains the boom-and-bust cycles. However, criminal abuse of the cryptocurrency ecosystem has created huge impediments for continued adoption, victimized innocent people around the world, and heightened calls for law enforcement and regulatory authority involvement.
Cryptocurrency-based crime hit a new all-time high in 2021 with illicit addresses receiving $14 billion over the course of the year, up from $7.8 billion in 2020. 3 The most common type of crime were “rug pulls” associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, a relatively new scam in which developers built what appeared to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects before taking investors’ money and disappearing. DeFi transaction volume, coupled with the proliferation of newly created DeFi tokens (absent requisite code audits), understandably lured bad actors. In nearly all cases, developers tricked investors into purchasing tokens associated with a DeFi project before draining the tools provided by those investors, sending the token’s value to zero in the process. While the focus has been on DeFi-related crime, other threats, such as ransomware, cryptocurrency money laundering, and non-fungible token (NFT)-related fraud are on the rise. As law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice develop their ability to seize illicit cryptocurrency and build out their blockchain-based investigative capabilities, regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission are actively examining whether cryptocurrency should be classified as security and/or commodity.4
Champions of cryptocurrency have touted the inclusion of the unbanked, efficiencies of transactions, and the security of blockchain. While many people with low-income may not
qualify for loans, invest, or open an account with traditional banks, cryptocurrency promotes equal access to financial products. Cryptocurrency also provides easy, low-cost, and speedy processing of payments and money transfers. Furthermore, the distributed system protects the blockchain from collapse at a single point of failure. Critics of cryptocurrency have pointed to its volatility, criminal syndicates that use the platform, and the environmental impact of mining activities. The no-holds-barred cryptocurrency environment has resulted in consumer scams, fraud, and theft. Nation-states have also used cryptocurrency to bypass sanctions while terrorist organizations and drug cartels have used exchanges to launder money. Moreover, mining activities associated with cryptocurrency not only draw on electricity, but also produce carbon emissions, and e-waste.5

### Key Action Items:
Firstly you need to understand how cryptocurrencies work. What is the technology behind the system? What are the market trends and dynamics? Then you are asked to analyze the economic impact of the ecosystem. Consider trading volumes, price fluctuations, and market capitalization. Use economic modeling to predict the effects of cryptocurrencies on various economic indicators, such as inflation, GDP, and unemployment. Examine the legal aspects: how are cryptocurrencies regulated? What do you see as the missing pieces? Investigate the ethical implications, such as What is the environmental impact of mining? And how are qualities like anonymity and privacy can be a challenge for law enforcement or financial regulators?
