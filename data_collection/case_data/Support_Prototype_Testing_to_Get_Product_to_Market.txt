Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing, Product Design & Development, Product Design & Development, Purchasing, Logistics, Supply Chain, Research & Development

### Background and Objective:
The company plans to launch new flavors to the market, but before doing that, they want to ensure that the best flavors will be produced and customers will be satisfied. Help the organization go through the research and development process to get the best results. Support prototype testing and development to get a product to market: make decisions on flavors, participate in recipe testing, provide a list of suppliers, collaborate with artists to create attractive packaging for the product, and participate in the social media campaign.
About the company: Oh Lait! Oh Lait! was inspired by the fruits, the drinks, and the sweet confections from Latin America and the Caribbean. As a young girl, founder, and CEO, Soroya Pognon remembers the best conversations and memories around the kitchen table. There, she learned how to make food, bake cakes and make ice cream.
Years later, she took the simple ice cream recipe and experimented with various fruits her parents often talked of. She soon realized that she not only created something people loved, but it was something that immediately transported them to another world- a spoonful of paradise.

### Key Action Items:
After you’ve become familiar with the company’s vision, mission, and business model, you need to specify the target audience and create a customer persona. You’ll also participate in the flavor testing and decide on the most successful ones. Create a sales campaign, including strategies and tools for the new product. Take part in the social media campaign, and compose meaningful content. Collaborate with artists and the marketing team to design an attractive package for the new products. Finally, make a budget plan for the product launch with all the mentioned activities.
