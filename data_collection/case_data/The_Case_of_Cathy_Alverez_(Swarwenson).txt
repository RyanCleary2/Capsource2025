Title: The Case of Cathy Alverez (Swarwenson)

Topics: Individual and Family Advocacy, Public Administration

### Background and Objective:
Cathy is a 26 years old Latine and African-American woman with four school-aged children: Paul (11), Jacob (9), Robbie (8), and Jae (6). She is in a long-distance relationship with Jae’s father Jeb (37), who is working in the oil fields in the state of Wyoming. Recently, Cathy's former foster mother, Lottie, called child protective services because of her concerns about possible homelessness. Cathy and the children slept in the car for a few nights when there was a problem with their new house. When Cathy and her children moved into the new house, they discovered it had a pest problem. Cathy immediately reported the problem to the landlord, who said he was unaware of the issues and that it would take a few days to hire an exterminator. With no assistance from family and friends and lacking the financial resources for a multi-night stay in a hotel, Cathy decided she and the children could ‘camp out for a few nights in the family car until the new house was ready.

### Key Action Items:
Current/Main
: Cathy is an engaged parent. She is committed to her children never experiencing the neglect and abuse that she did as a child. She always attends her children's parent-teacher conferences, if she doesn't have to work. She enjoys her Friday night ritual of making popcorn and watching a Disney movie with her children. Cathy loves to have “dance parties” when she plays music and cleans up after dinner with the children. Cathy tries to maintain a schedule and bedtime routine for the children, but it isn't always possible with her work schedule.
The family just moved into a three-bedroom house. Cathy’s refrigerator has children's artwork on it and an A+ spelling test. There were dirty dishes in the sink, which Cathy profusely apologized about. The house is clean. The youngest two boys share a bedroom that has a double mattress on the floor. The older two have bunk beds. The top bunk does not have sheets on it, but there is a sleeping bag.  The furniture, which was donated to the family by a local church, is functional but worn.This isn't the first time she started over before. She explains that previously when she was moving out of an another place, she couldn't afford a moving truck. She realized that paying for a moving truck and movers was going to cost her the same amount of money to buy new things, so she moved without most of her belongings.Cathy works more than one job periodically and often has a friend or her former foster mom watch the children. At times Cathy works past the children’s bedtime. Most often, she wakes them up and takes them back to the apartment. Occasionally, Cathy’s former foster mom lets her sleep on the couch so the children’s sleep is not disrupted. The children are well-behaved and all are doing well, although Robbie has problems reading and has been screened for dyslexia. Cathy attended the IEP meeting in which she had lots of questions and did not fully understand what was needed. She is trying to enroll Robbie in classes in the community to help with his reading; however, there is a long waiting list.Cathy is knowledgeable and able to access resources for the family as needed. Previously when she had difficulty paying utilities, she was able to have bills covered by a local agency. She receives SNAP and she is able to make ends meet occasionally using a local food bank. When she learned Paul needed glasses following a vision screening at school, Cathy was able to find someone to help pay for them. She also ensured the children were “adopted” by a local agency so they would receive gifts for Christmas.  Cathy works in retail and has experience in many notable department stores. Her new supervisor wanted to hire her at a higher pay grade with more responsibility, but could not because Cathy doesn’t have a high school diploma or GED. Cathy wants to get her GED but says she has never been good in school. She struggles with math and doesn't like reading. She is proud of how good her children are in school and readily admits that she does not understand Paul and Jacob’s math homework. Jed currently works out of state in the oil fields in Wyoming. He earns more money in a week than he could in a month where they live. Jed sends home paychecks frequently. Cathy and Jed do video calls almost every day and he is a major supporter of her and the children. Jed earned a high school degree and started college community right after high school; however, he did not finish. Cathy has an elderly neighbor who sometimes comes to her house and watches TV while her children sleep at night if she needs to work evenings. In exchange, Cathy provides rides to the neighbor who is unable to drive. When interviewed, the neighbor says that Cathy is a loving mother and that she “would do anything for her kids.”Cathy emphasizes that she will do anything for her children. She says that if she could only get a stable job that had reliable hours and health insurance, she would be okay. She says that supporting her family on her income is really hard and she hopes that eventually, they can save up enough money to move to Wyoming to be near the oil fields where Jed works. She thinks that the cold will be hard, but she knows that being close to Jed will be very helpful. She's optimistic that there will be a lower cost of living.Cathy understands why she was reported to Child Protective Services. While she is upset, she knows that the instability and her housing problems aren't good for her children. Cathy doesn't know how she can really do everything on her own. She is hoping that the child welfare system can make referrals to help her support her family.
Scenario 1:
Child Protective Services investigation is launched.
Scenario 2:
During the second visit to the home, the CPI asks Cathy about her background. Cathy shares her history in foster care, the three pregnancies before the age of 18, the lack of child support from the fathers, as well as Jeb's physical absence over the last five years. The CPI notes the failure of the system to hold the fathers accountable and possible next steps to assist Cathy and the children.
Scenario 3:
In the course of the investigation, Cathy reveals that the neighbor fell and broke her hip two days ago, and is unable to supervise the children for the foreseeable future. Cathy is working the day shift right now, but starting in three days she is expected to work evenings over the next 3 weeks.
