Title: Food System Resiliency - An Island Approach to Global Issues

Topics: Growth Strategy, Product Design & Development, Sales & Business Development

### Background and Objective:
Piko Provisions was founded with one goal: to provide the best organic food for babies in Hawaii and beyond. Piko baby food products have no artificial flavours, preservatives, or additives. We deliver sustainable foods made from all-natural Hawaii-grown ingredients and superfoods. We support local agriculture by sourcing all our ingredients from Hawaii-based farmers and producers to build a more sustainable agricultural industry on our islands. Furthermore, we care about the environment and make sure that all of our ingredients are grown and harvested by our growing partners using regenerative farming practices to prevent land degradation and to show respect for the planet that nurtures us. We aim to increase food system resiliency and representation by developing regionally sourced and manufactured food and drinks for the next generation with ingredients sourced from regenerative farmers.

### Key Action Items:
Our goal is to reach the next growth stage after successfully launching our first three products. By working on this case, you will help us identify the next three natural and organic baby food products to launch based on market research, boots-on-the-ground fieldwork with customers, farmers, investors, and the community, and analysis of industry trends and competition. The case requires creative thinking, analyzing data, and developing innovative solutions to meet the target consumersâ€™ needs and help the company grow in the market.
