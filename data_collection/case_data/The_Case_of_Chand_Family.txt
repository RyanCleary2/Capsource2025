### Key Action Items:
Susie has had difficulty sleeping the last several months. In addition, after noticing that her clothes were no longer fitting - she went to the doctor and was surprised to learn she had gained 15lbs in less than a year. When the doctor asked her if anything had changed recently, Susie replied, “Nothing really - you know my mom is getting older, Derek is never home, and the kids are rambunctious as always. You know, everyday normal stuff - nothing big.” Her doctor then asked if she felt overwhelmed or stressed. Susie immediately responded with a half-hearted laugh, “I feel stress all the time, but who doesn’t. It’s life.” Her doctor stated that it may be worth talking to someone. Susie said she was way too busy, but would think about it.A week later, Susie decided to contact a mental health (MH) facility and schedule an intake appointment with a therapist. During their first meeting, Susie shared the following information:Susie works in human resources at a local large nonprofit; she has been there for a few years. She adores her work at the agency, which provides job readiness training.  Her husband, Derek is a consultant who travels a lot; he is on the road on average 75% of the year. Their son is the oldest, RJ, is nine years old. They also have two six year old twin girls, Simone and Nina. In addition, Marilyn Jansen, Susie’s mother moved in with them four years ago when Susie’s father, Thomas, died. Susie loves her mom and appreciates her help. With Derek traveling so much, historically Marilyn has been very helpful to Susie.Over the last few years, Marilyn has helped raise the children and assisted in running the household. With Derek traveling more and more, Susie knows that it would have been very difficult for her to work fulltime without her mother living with them. Now that the children are all school age, Marilyn assists in sending them off to school each morning. She is unable to carpool to pick up the children after school, but is there when they get home. Susie states that her mom is friendly and cheerful. She also states, Marilyn adores her grandchildren and family. In the beginning, Marilyn helped more with the housework and kitchen cooking, however, with her health issues she has been doing less and less overtime. Susie is even beginning to have  doubts about if her mother is actually able to fully care for the children now. A few weeks ago, Simone and Nina crawled into the attic. When Susie got home, Marilyn did not know where the twins were. In addition, Marilyn couldn’t say how long it had been since she had seen them last. Susie asked RJ, who was playing video games, and he didn’t know where they were either. Susie frantically searched the house trying to find the girls. When she ran into their room, she heard giggling and realized the two girls accessed the attic through their closet.Susie says with her mother no longer able to help cook or clean around the house she feels a great amount of stress. Marilyn has diabetes and has been experiencing some health issues. Susie has some concerns that her mom may be showing signs of possible self neglect. For example, Susie is concerned that her mom is not following doctor's orders. Over the last year or two, Marilyn has had several infections on her feet. At one point, the ulcer on the bottom of her foot became so infected that Marilyn had to be hospitalized and receive IV treatments.Susie is also starting to suspect that her mom may be having additional health problems related to memory loss.Upon reflection, Susie said at times she feels frustrated at her mother’s choices concerning her health. She is frustrated by the fact that her mother is not following her doctor’s orders. Susie sees this as an unnecessary hassle that could be avoided if Marilyn just did what she was supposed to do. Susie is frustrated and feels that she has one more person to take care of. Susie also feels guilty for having these feelings toward her mother.Susie said beyond the stress and frustration, she is “flat out angry with her husband” for a multitude of reasons. To begin with, Derek is always on the road. Derek travels 75% of the time. He used to come home every weekend if he had to travel for work, but now he often stays on the road for the weekend if he feels it is a fun location. A few weeks ago he was on assignment in New York City. Instead of coming home for the weekend and going to one of RJ’s soccer matches, which he had promised to attend, he stayed in New York and texted pictures of his sightseeing. This angers Susie because Derek has a responsibility to be an attentive and responsive father.In addition to Derek’s lack of engagement with the family, Susie says Derek doesn’t respect her career path in HR. She is currently being considered for a promotion that will be more demanding. It is Susie’s ‘dream job’ and it would come with a significant pay raise. If she gets the promotion, she will earn almost as much money as Derek. She hopes that this will help him value her career as seriously as his.As Susie shares everything, she suddenly becomes very quiet. At the end of the session, she says, “I did not realize how many things were really bothering me. I am not sure how to keep everything at home afloat and still pursue my career. I am just completely overwhelmed and I honestly do not know how I am going to do it all.”
Scenario A:
Upon Susie’s urging, Marilyn agrees to a physical and mental health evaluation. The family is happy to learn that Marilyn’s mental capacity and brain function is excellent. She does have a few physical health issues, but the primary concern is that Marilyn has severe depression and she may benefit from an inpatient facility or at the very least a break from the family home to focus on
her
mental health.
Scenario B:
After several therapy sessions and receiving her new promotion, Susie confronts Derek about his lack of engagement with the children, the constant traveling for work, and lack of commitment to his and Susie’s relationship. She asks Derek to attend couples therapy. Derek states that he does not need couple’s therapy and that Susie needs to stop complaining all the time. A week later, Derek misses all scheduled soccer games due to flight delays last weekend. He realizes that his career is taking away his ability to spend time with his kids. He quits his job without telling Susie and heads home. When he arrives, no one is in the house and there is an envelope on his desk. It is a letter from Susie stating that she is leaving and is filing for divorce.
Scenario C
: RJ and the twins are left at school with no ride home for the third time in a matter of weeks. RJ knows the school gets upset when they are left there so he tries frantically to reach his grandma and parents. No one is answering their cell phones, so RJ tells the twins - “We might as well walk home. It is not that far.” They begin walking and RJ soon realizes they took a wrong turn along the way. It is beginning to get dark and now his cell phone is dead from trying to call his family so many times. They keep walking trying to figure out where to go. The girls are cold and hungry. Nine year old RJ is not sure what to do. Just then a police car rolls up and the officer asks them if they are okay. Next, the policy officer calls the child abuse hotline to make a report.
