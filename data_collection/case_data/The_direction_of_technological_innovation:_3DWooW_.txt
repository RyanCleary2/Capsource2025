### Background and Objective:
Section Not Found

### Key Action Items:
We suggest starting with identifying the key questions that need to be answered in the case. Brainstorm all the different aspects from an industry and technology standpoint to a company core competencies analysis. Define the overall market: What is the growth opportunity? What do you know about the competitive environment? Prepare a competitor analysis, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of 3DWooW Technology Co.
After all the ideas from the brainstorming section have been collected, it is time to organize key issues in an Issue Tree. Using each of the assigned questions in the case, the branches should represent areas to be researched, starting from the major question and branching down into individual issues. Students should address the MECE rule when identifying branches (issues) of the project. Each branch should be mutually exclusive, with no overlaps, and collectively exhaustive,Â  leaving no gaps in the analysis.
Develop a sustainable scale-up plan for 3DWoow growth potential or first mover advantage. Prepare a map about industry stakeholders: What partnerships are needed to launch this initiative? Create a launch plan by defining target industries. Which products and/or services should 3DWooW consider developing in the short and long term? Is 3DWooW producing software, hardware, or both? What types of new partnerships and commercial leads need to be developed to leverage the business? Produce a road map and outline the steps 3DWooW needs to take to enter the selected industry.
