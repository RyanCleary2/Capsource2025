Title: Propose a Holistic Strategy for a Culture of Sustainability at a Multinational Corporation

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility, Operations, Organizational Culture

### Background and Objective:
The leadership at Hioki knows that to be effective; sustainability efforts must be holistic and integrated into the organizational culture and system of incentives and decision-making. With more than 900 employees across over 30 locations, Hoiki aims to elevate its commitment and value to global sustainability efforts by developing an organizational culture of sustainability, one that extends across the company’s multi-national corporation to endow employees and other stakeholders with a sense of sustainability ownership and empower individual and collective action. Ideally, efforts to elevate sustainability will be something that everyone at Hioki will be involved in adapting to each day- at least to some extent - rather than change initiated and monitored by top leaders alone. Hioki is asking you to propose a strategy to sustain this cultural change in the company.
