Title: Reluctant to Report: One Charitable Organization’s Experience with Fraud

Topics: Legal, Regulatory, Compliance

### Background and Objective:
The chair of the board of directors for a local non-profit (dedicated to providing social services to families of children who have degenerative diseases) sat in her office contemplating the fate of the organization. Just an hour earlier she had been notified by the auditor that the CEO confessed to skimming funds, misclassifying restricted donations, and creating a fictitious vendor through which he paid himself without supplying the goods that the invoices claimed. The frauds perpetrated totaled approximately $25,000.The CEO had been at his post for many years and had earned the respect and trust of the community. The organization’s mission had been achieved and in fact had expanded under the CEO’s tenure. Still, with the recession, the organization’s reserves were near depletion. The CEO could not have picked a worse time to breach his fiduciary duties given that the organization had just “kicked off” their capital campaign. The chair worried how all this would be received by the community if it became public.
When the CEO admitted to the fraud, he explained the dire personal circumstances that led to his dishonest conduct. His wife was suffering from terminal cancer, had consequently quit her job, and he was left as the sole support for his family. He agreed to legitimately borrow against his home to pay back the stolen money, but conditioned his agreement on being allowed to leave “quietly” so that he would be able to seek other employment to pay his debts and support his family.
Empathy for the CEO and other practical reasons made the chair reluctant to report the incident to the authorities and handle the matter internally. The chair knew that the organization did not have the financial resources to litigate the matter if the CEO did not pay voluntarily. By settling with the CEO, the organization stood a better chance of getting its money back.
With the admission of guilt by the CEO, assurance that the funds would be paid back, and his immediate resignation, the chair believed that justice would be served. However, the chair wasn’t sure if failure to report the incident to authorities was ethical. The CEO had committed a series of financial crimes against a charitable organization that he was entrusted to serve. In the major scandals of the previous decade, many CEOs were given long sentences for abusing their power and taking corporate funds. Here was someone who took from the most vulnerable population.
The chair wondered what would prevent this from happening in the future to some other organization that the CEO might work for. What if other employees knew about the CEO’s conduct? A quiet departure could invite more dishonesty in the organization. Finally, the community that supported the organization might lose faith in the board and in future leadership if others disclosed the fraud rather than the board. One can never count on a secret being kept. The chair had to think of how to best instill confidence in the remaining employees and donors considering the alternatives of reporting the fraud to law enforcement or risking the news getting out without the board being the one to disclose it. Most importantly, the chair had to grapple with what was the right thing to do ethically.
This case was written by Dr. Paul Melendez, Department of Management and Organizations, The University of Arizona. August 20, 2011. The case is fictional, but represents a potential dilemma confronted by non-profit boards.

### Key Action Items:
Firstly, you are asked to understand the non-profit organization's mission and leadership structure. Introduce the CEO and explain the circumstances that led to their actions. Explain how the embezzlement was discovered. Describe the legal and ethical consequences faced by the CEO due to his actions. This might include criminal charges, restitution payments, or professional sanctions. Discuss the ethical implications of the CEO's actions and whether any lessons can be learned from this case study. Consider questions such as: Was the CEO's behavior ever justifiable? How could the non-profit organization have prevented this from happening? What impact did the embezzlement have on the organization's stakeholders? Sum up the key takeaways from the case study, and offer recommendations for how non-profit organizations can avoid similar situations.
