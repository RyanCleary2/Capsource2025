### Background and Objective:
Duke Davis is a 74-year-old Vietnam veteran who witnessed the death of a family member, as well as crimes against humanity while serving his country. He suffers from multiple forms of PTSD, which along with substance abuse, has led to the breakdown of the family unit and other key relationships resulting in homelessness, food scarcity, and additional mental health issues. He has struggled throughout his life with formative relationships, bonding/supporting others, and money management/fiscal choices. He has a long history of anger management issues within the workplace, difficulty engaging and/or maintaining family ties, and his substance abuse has caused additional distance from his family members. He tends to choose being alone vs addressing issues in personal relationships, as well as, his community. Duke left his wife, Lyla, and their children over 20 years ago after the VA provided an official diagnosis of PTSD and granted him full disability. In his second relationship, Duke and his partner, Janelle, parted ways after she became very ill and Duke was unable to commit to assisting her while she was sick. Mr. Davis’ main form of companionship over the years has been animal rescues.

Scenario B: Duke spent most of his day collecting cans and bottles to return to the local recycling center. While at the center he tied his dog, Champ, to a post outside of the center. During that time, it was reported that Champ growled at a group of boys and seemed aggressive. The owner of the recycling center called Animal Control. When they arrived they asked for Champ’s license, shot record, and proof of ownership, which Duke did not have. When they attempted to take Champ - Duke became very angry and tried to take Champ. Police were then called. Duke was not arrested, but he was taken to the local hospital for a mental health evaluation.
Scenario C: Duke received his monthly VA check. He rented a local room for himself and his dog, Champ. Duke spent most of the day drinking. He left briefly to get more alcohol. When he returned another patron knocked on his door stating that the dog had been barking while Duke was gone and the patron was reporting the issue to the hotel manager. The patron and Duke began arguing, which escalated into a physical altercation inside Duke’s room. The police were called. Duke was verbally and physically aggressive toward the responding police officer resulting in Duke being taken into custody and arrested. Upon sentencing, he was required to be evaluated and return to court. The behavioral health unit facility recommended a minimum of a 28 day stay, which the judge mandated. If not completed - Duke could face a fine and jail time.
