Title: Build the GENUINO USA Go-To-Market Roadmap

Topics: Growth Strategy, Marketing, Reporting, Financial Planning & Analysis

### Background and Objective:
GENUINO, an early-stage Italian start-up, is building its US go-to-market strategy. The specific focus of this project is to explore how GENUINO can leverage it's their blockchain certification technology and community engagement platform across multiple sectors, including sports, music, art, and fashion, to build and grow revenue streams for all points of engagement in the life of the collectible (NFT + Physical).
This idea is holistic: how can all points of contact (athletes, teams, artists, musicians, fashion designers, collectors, and fans) monetize opportunities within the US as they look to gain value and enrich their experience with athletes and teams through the use of NFTs, proprietary to the GENUINO marketplace, which uniquely incorporates physical asset blockchain certification protocol.
Genuino has successfully launched pilot partnerships that validate its model in Europe. They're connecting the "physical" world with the blockchain to make "memorabilia" more trackable and thus easy to confirm as authentic. As the global leader in sports and entertainment, of course, Genuino wants to enter the US market. Given their existing capabilities, they seek help analyzing ways they can enter the US market and explore new ways to address the market that might make them uniquely valuable. It would be prudent to explore some of their early partnerships to understand the basis for their product vision and business strategy. It will also help to dive into the video interviews with founders, which contain important information about their business strategy.

### Key Action Items:
After you’ve become familiar with Genuino’s vision, mission, and value proposition, deep dive into this niche market and get acquainted with NFTs, the company’s business model, and its target personas. Create a competitor analysis to examine Genuino’s market position in the US. Define TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM, and SOM. What are the key sectors and subsets would adopt GENUINO’s marketplace in the United States? Finally, draft an Executive Memo (including Appendix and Citations) explaining your comprehensive ‘Go-to-Market’ strategy that positions the GENUINO as a high-end marketplace in the US Market NFT sport collectible space. Creative market strategies should include proposed innovative collaboration between athletics (both individual athletes and teams) and fashion/art/music, which are designed to yield the most sought-after NFTs in the United States.
