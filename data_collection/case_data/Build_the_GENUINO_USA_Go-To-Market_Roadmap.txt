After you’ve become familiar with Genuino’s vision, mission, and value proposition, deep dive into this niche market and get acquainted with NFTs, the company’s business model, and its target personas. Create a competitor analysis to examine Genuino’s market position in the US. Define TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM, and SOM. What are the key sectors and subsets would adopt GENUINO’s marketplace in the United States? Finally, draft an Executive Memo (including Appendix and Citations) explaining your comprehensive ‘Go-to-Market’ strategy that positions the GENUINO as a high-end marketplace in the US Market NFT sport collectible space. Creative market strategies should include proposed innovative collaboration between athletics (both individual athletes and teams) and fashion/art/music, which are designed to yield the most sought-after NFTs in the United States.
