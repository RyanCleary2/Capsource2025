### Key Action Items:
Main/Current Event:
Veronica and Sondra are parents of Dwayne, a five and half-year old little boy who they adopted out of foster care. Veronica and Sondra recently divorced and Sondra is the primary custodial parent. Dwayne lives with Sondra and Jan, Sondra’s girlfriend, in Jan’s home. Sondra consistently drops off Dwayne whenever she needs ‘childcare’. Sondra does not work, so this  is often so that Sondra can go shopping or go on vacation or if she and Jan have plans.
Veronica loves seeing Dwayne and wants to spend as much time as possible with him, so she tries to be as accommodating as possible. She has asked Sondra multiple times to work out a consistent visitation schedule for Dwayne. Sondra says she will but never does. The constant fluctuation in the visitation schedule is problematic for both Dwayne and Veronica. Dwayne has missed doctors' appointments, field trip permission slips are often lost or not handed in on time, etc. Veronica has often had to reschedule appointments at work or requested the day off at the last minute. This often impacts her sleeping and eating due to the additional stress of making up hours at work or the fear of losing her job. When Veronica reaches her breaking point and tries to firmly advocate for a more consistent schedule - Sondra often responds by restricting Dwayne’s visits often for days or even a week at a time.
Last week, Sondra called Veronica’s work phone and left a message. She also sent her a text telling her she was unable to pick Dwayne up from school and that Veronica would need to pick him up. Working on a major installation that day at the gallery, Veronica did not have time to check either phone throughout the day. Around 3:30 PM, the school called the gallery for Veronica. They stated that once again Dwayne was left at the school with no one to pick him up. Veronica rushed to pick him up. While the school was sympathetic, they stated that this was the fifth time in two months and simply unacceptable. By the end of the week, CPS arrived at Veronica’s place of employment.
Precipitating Events:
Veronica came home early to meet Sondra and attend Dwayne’s soccer game. When she walked into their kitchen, Sondra was kissing another woman - Jan. Veronica was in shock and quickly left the house. Sondra called her and Veronica told her she needed some time to think and that she would be home in a few days. She called the next morning to talk to Dwayne before he went to school and to tell him that she loved him. She spoke to Sondra briefly stating that there was no one to cover her at the new gallery installment and she would be home late that night, but she would be home to try to talk things out. When Veronica got home around 8:00 PM the house was dark. Veronica assumed that Sondra had put Dwayne to bed a little early so that they could talk.
When Veronica walked in the door, the house was completely empty except for Veronica’s personal items. Sondra had taken everything in the house and left with Dwayne. In the kitchen, she left a short note stating that although she wished things had ended differently, she simply did not love Veronica anymore. She had filed for divorce and Veronica should expect to receive papers shortly. She was in love with Jan and that they were starting a new life together raising Dwayne in Jan’s home. Sondra stated that she would still
allow
Veronica to see Dwayne, but it would be on Sondra’s schedule until visitation was established by the court.
Veronica was beyond hurt and confused. How could Sondra just take her son? She quickly called Sondra on her cellphone. When Sondra answered she made it clear that Dwayne was to live with her, stating that she collected documentation over the last several months concerning Veronica’s mental health and her prescription drug use. Sondra continued on the phone stating that if Veronica pushed for custody in court, Sondra would ensure that Veronica would get the bare minimum of supervised visitation of Dwayne. Veronica said okay and hung up the phone completely in a daze. In a matter of days, her whole world had changed.
Scenario 1:
CPI launches an investigation after the school reports that Dwayne has repeatedly not been picked up after school. This catapults Veronica to finally take legal action and request full custody of Dwayne allowing Sondra visitation.
Scenario 2:
Sondra files restraining order against Veronica due to willful endangerment and neglect. In addition, she cites Veronica’s mental health history and prescription drugs as additional evidence that Veronica is unstable and should only have supervised visits.
Scenario 3:
Dwayne’s biological mother, Tina, lives in St. Petersburg and is now sober. She was using drugs when she signed the papers relinquishing her rights to Dwayne and she deeply regrets giving him up. She contacts foster care and the Dept of Children and Families when she learns from a friend that Dwayne’s current family is under investigation due to neglect.
