### Key Action Items:
Understanding the Terrain: As Words Alive commences on its transformative journey into a thought leadership role, a critical juncture demands a comprehensive grasp of the dynamic policy landscape governing education and literacy. Our commitment to this evolution is underpinned by the recognition that policy decisions, both recent and impending, hold the power to shape the trajectory of our mission. The goal is clear: to ascertain the organization's position within the spectrum of policy discussions at both the state and federal levels.
Key Policy Issues: The first step in this strategic endeavor is the creation of a primer, a meticulously curated document outlining key policy issues related to education and literacy in California and on the federal stage. This will serve as our compass, guiding us through the complexities of recent, monumental, or currently debated policies. By delving into the nuances of these policies, we aim to decipher their implications on our work, understanding where Words Alive stands within the broader policy discourse. Whether they have been recently enacted, stand as landmarks in educational reform, or are subjects of ongoing discussions, we aim to discern if, where, and how we can strategically position ourselves to contribute meaningfully to the discourse.
Strategic Navigation: The actionable insights gleaned from this document will empower our leadership to make informed decisions on where and how we can effectively step into the policy space. This strategic navigation involves not only understanding our current position but also identifying areas where our unique expertise and programs can contribute significantly. The objective is to transform policy discussions into opportunities for advocacy, ensuring that our voice resonates in shaping policies that promote literacy and education. Through this approach, Words Alive envisions not only adapting to policy changes but actively influencing them to create a future where the transformative power of words is universally accessible.
