### Background and Objective:
Tim Smith is a 33-year-old, white, heterosexual, and married male. He has been married to his wife Rachel, 26, for a little over five years. They have four young children - Timothy Jr. (4), twins Emanuel and Grace (2 ½), and their youngest - Daniel who just turned one. In addition, Tim and Rachel just found out last week that they are pregnant with their second set of twins. The family is of strong religious faith and they hold a strict adherence to the tenants of their religion.
Tim was recently involved in a physical altercation at his workplace. His company suspended him and has required that he attend a program that will provide anger management services before he will be allowed to return to work. He has been referred by his job’s HR (human resource) department to help with his anger management. During intake, Tim is assigned to the open anger management group for men at the agency which is led by a male social worker, Mark. Tim is also referred to concurrent individual therapy sessions to complement group counseling services. The group consists of five other men. Tim has never received or voluntarily sought mental health services. He is skeptical of a bunch of men sitting around “crying” and “sharing their feelings.”

### Key Action Items:
Main/Current:
Tim Smith was recently referred by his company’s HR department to a community mental health center after he was in a physical altercation at work with another worker, Jeff Stevens.  Recently, Tim has had difficulty sleeping at night and this affected his concentration at work. He has made some minor mistakes. Tim’s coworker, Jeff, has noticed these mistakes and has been making inappropriate comments to Tim. Some of the comments Jeff makes clearly disrespect Tim’s religion and beliefs. Tim mentioned the comments to his supervisor, who did not seem overly concerned. He told Tim to ignore Jeff and for him to focus more on doing a good job at work.
Tim knew that he had a family counting on him, so he tried to stay out of Jeff’s way, and tried to get a better night's sleep. He was starting to get back on track when Rachel shared that they were pregnant again. Tim took time off to go with Rachel to her OB/GYN appt. Last week, Jeff made a comment about the fact that Tim’s wife, Rachel, is always pregnant. When he returned to work he told his boss that Rachel was pregnant with their second set of twins. Hearing the news a bit later, Jeff saw Tim in the breakroom and said, “Man, you can’t give that girl a break - can you? You are like a rutting dog.” Sleep deprived, fiscally stressed, and overwhelmed; for Tim, this was the last straw. In a fit of rage, Tim walked up to Jeff and punched him in the face knocking him out cold.
His supervisor immediately told him to leave work. The next day human resources (HR) contacted Tim to let him know that he has been suspended from work without pay until he attended and successfully completed an anger management group program. While speaking with HR, Tim shares his concerns about being out of work because he is the sole financial provider for his family. HR encourages him to utilize the company’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) while suspended to assist. It is a free resource that can assist Tim in terms of community referrals, financial counseling, etc.
Tim is at a personal crossroads. He is very religious and describes himself as a “fundamentalist” who lives a very traditional and conservative lifestyle. He and his wife, Rachel, believe that guidance and decision-making should be done with the assistance of their pastor or another male church leader. This is in strict adherence to the tenants of their religion. As a result, Tim has a very hard time opening up to individuals who are not church leaders, even other family members. At times, Tim still has a hard time opening up to Rachel, especially about finances, the stress he is experiencing, or anything he feels a man ‘should be able to handle on his own.’ This mentality has kept Tim from ever seeking mental health services.
Tim joins an open anger management group for men at a community mental health group therapy program. The center provides open group counseling for both involuntary and voluntary clients. It is led by a male social worker (SW), Mark, age 42. As the group leader, Mark welcomes Tim to the community center and offers Tim 1:1 counseling sessions, in addition to the group sessions, if Tim is interested. Tim considers it because he is very worried about the group members judging his beliefs, especially not using contraception. He worries about what will happen to his job if the group criticizes his lifestyle and/or religious beliefs especially if he loses his temper again.
In addition to Mark and Tim, the anger management group consists of five other men who exhibit varying degrees of motivation and engagement:
Larry, age 63, is a member of the Oath Keepers who was arrested at the Capitol insurrection on Jan 6th, 2021 in Washington, D.C. He was mandated by the courts to attend an anger management program. Based on his last group leaders evaluation concerning his lack of engagement and aggressive behavior he is now in his second anger management program.
Chad, age 24, is an atheist who has always thought of himself as a pacifist until a few months ago. At his in-laws last month his father-in-law, Doug, began his usual rhetoric about how disgusting homosexuals were even though he knew Chad’s brother is part of the LGBTQ+ community. Chad’s wife, Jennifer, tried to transition the conversation with little luck. Doug mentioned the recent reversal of Roe vs Wade and said “It's a beginning. I cannot wait for the ruling on those gays and they lose everything. Nothing, but perverts and pedophiles.”  Chad went on a verbal tirade calling Doug every derogatory name he could think of before leaving and slamming the door. When his wife got home instead of trying to talk calmly, Chad continued to yell until she told him to leave. He left, but still upset he punched the car windshield and broke it. Jennifer told him to leave and get counseling or they were getting a divorce.
Frank, age 37,  is a black retired military who spent almost a decade in Afghanistan. While serving he contracted malaria and was in a military hospital when U.S. troops began pulling out of Afghanistan in August 2021. Upon returning to the U.S. Frank still had trouble sleeping and bouts of memory loss and confusion. Recently, he was at a family BBQ and ended up in a physical altercation with one of his cousins. He remembers getting upset about anti-war rhetoric, but the rest is foggy. He believes his anger is causing him to have these episodes where he literally feels like he is experiencing memory loss or at the very least periods where his memory is foggy. After speaking with his family and friends he decides to voluntarily seek counseling and treatment for his anger issues. He sees Mark each week for 1:1 counseling and then again during the anger group management meeting.
Carlos, age 34, is a Latinx male from Mexico. He had originally applied for asylum two years ago after he barely escaped from a failed kidnapping attempt by the cartel. He immediately headed for the Mexico/U.S. border where he spent over a year -  first detained and then expelled back to Mexico under Title 42. He began to suffer depression and anger issues after the kidnapping, which only increased during the detainment. He believed it was because he feared for his life. Yet, three months ago his asylum was approved and he was now legally part of the local U.S. community, but his anger issues and depression did not improve. Concerned with a baby on the way, Carlos sought help voluntarily so that he could be a positive role model in his daughter’s life.
Steve (real name Alo), age 62, is a Native American Lakota tribe member. He was arrested a few years ago at Standing Rock during a NoDAPL protest. Then last year he got into a bar fight with a guy who was harassing his girlfriend. The guy made several derogatory remarks about Steve being Native American and his girlfriend being white. The guy then took a swing at Steve, so Steve grabbed him and bounced his face off the bar. The fight was broken up and the men were told to leave. As Steve put his car in gear a police car pulled up behind him blocking him in. The man he assaulted was a cop and he filed assault charges. Steve was mandated to an anger management program and 200 hours of community service by the court.
Scenario 1:
Tim attends the group meetings and over time attempts to engage with the other group members. On his first day of sharing, Chad states, “Tim is a misogynistic, fundamentalist nut-wing, and everything that is wrong with the United States of America.” Larry immediately interjects stating, “it's Chad’s sissy, snowflake ways that are the real issue in the U.S.” Chaos ensues, and the rest of the group aggressively chimes in.
Scenario 2:
Tim refuses to attend group counseling, but comes to every 1:1 session with his SW, Mark. Mark feels that while Tim is making progress, he would really benefit from the group therapy. Tim’s employee assistance program (EAP) requires a progress update before the company will allow Tim to return to work.
Scenario 3:
Tim and Rachel meet with their pastor who recommends that Tim talk to one of the lawyers in the parish about possible employment-based religious discrimination. The pastor states that he believes that Tim’s actions at work were justified based on Steven's remarks.
