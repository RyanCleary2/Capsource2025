Title: AVAWA Impact: Transforming Women's Lives in Africa

Topics: No Topics Found

### Background and Objective:
Our case focuses on developing the African informal economy, addressing harmful traditional practices and violence against women. We also explore the interplay between the Sustainable Development Goals' 2063 agenda and Culture.
Individual reactions to gender, ethnicity, race, and other differences are influenced by exposure and cultural background. National origin and other factors also shape group perspectives. These intersections give rise to complex human challenges spanning history, present, and future. Our goal is to research and propose sustainable solutions to these challenges. Harmony across these intersections is both attainable and crucial. Intercultural harmony, alongside gender harmony, is critical to achieving equality and a peaceful society. The high costs of violence against women and underrepresentation drive us to eliminate these issues. The Anti-Violence Against Women Act embodies our mission to create an equitable, inclusive, and just society by eradicating harmful practices.
Through our organization, African Views, we engage in research and development initiatives centered on African cultural structures and intelligence globally. We aim to showcase African values and tackle challenges through partnerships, seeking sustainable solutions for harmony, peace, and unity. With worldwide branches and academic chapters, our interdisciplinary approach combines modern innovation with ancient wisdom to address the challenges of intersectionality and existentialism. Our case strives to nurture equality and harmony in the African informal economy, advocating for women's rights and eradicating harmful practices, all while fostering intercultural and gender harmony for a better society.

### Key Action Items:
Operationalizing the AVAWA Framework:
AVAWA is an acronym for "Anti Violence Against Women Act," it has three components: The AVAWA bill, the network, and the Association. The components are designed to provide advocacy, education, and awareness, gender-sensitive legislation, mobilization, access to justice, capacity building for law enforcement and judicial officers, and increasing gender equality in decision and policy-maker institutions.
The bill
is designed to ensure that a nation adopts a comprehensive plan of how to recognize the challenges faced by women and intends to address those issues. Although having a law and making law enforcement authorities care about these issues are two different things. Choose an African country and help restructure the bill so it can be implemented into their day-to-day basis. Reveal their most significant challenges and battles, and try to work out a framework that could be implemented.
The network
is a database of women's needs service providers. The AVAWA network directory system is necessary for identifying and mapping out the resources accessible to communities and locating any potential service gaps. Conduct a needs assessment of your chosen country, unveil women's most challenging needs and gaps, and propose solutions and plausible partnerships to address them so we can expand our network.
The Association
is the best proxy for monitoring and evaluating the bill's and the network's effectiveness. These are local community-based women's groups, such as the African Views Association for Women's Advancement (founded in 2013). Help us develop a united and transparent evaluation framework and KPI system for the Association so feedback can be provided and necessary changes can be made. Also, develop a plan that helps monitor the Association's effectiveness.
