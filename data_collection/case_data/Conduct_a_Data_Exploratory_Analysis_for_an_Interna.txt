### Background and Objective:
Weather affects every business. WeatherTrends360's proprietary year-ahead forecasting model of seasonal sales and weather tells you what's coming, giving you time to plan inventory, advertising, allocation, and markdowns proactively. Trusted by the Fortune 100 and Main Street, it's the next generation of weather-based predictive analytics. Our passion is Better Business in any Weather. Our technology predicts year-ahead weekly temperatures, rainfall, and snowfall by a week out one year for every 1 mile on Earth. It also predicts any 3rd party metric where 3-5+ years of weekly data are available by location.
Weather Trends International, Inc. is looking for new verticals where the year-ahead predictive sales and weather analytics can help in humanitarian sectors, precisely how disease or hospital applications predict emergency room visits due to weather conditions associated with climate change; extremes in the rain, snow, heat, cold all create a big influx in a surprise emergency room visits and exacerbate diseases outbreaks such as Malaria.

### Key Action Items:
We want to see how weather conditions and events negatively impact health in the context of climate change; in addition, we want to know which countries and humanitarian sectors would benefit most from our forecast. For instance, how do heat or drought conditions lead to certain illnesses? Choose different weather conditions that have been shown to increase certain diseases (e.g., asthma, heat stroke), and answer the questions:
What use cases exist for understanding the impact of [your chosen weather condition] and illness?
What markets and audiences need/value the understandings and insights that can be gained through data analysis on [your chosen weather condition] and illness?
How would data and information for understanding the relationship between [your chosen weather condition] and illnesses help them to reach their goals?
What questions do they have?
How would they use the information? How might they use the information to inform decision-making?
