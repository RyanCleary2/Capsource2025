### Key Action Items:
After understanding the company’s vision, mission, and value proposition, we want you to dive deeper into the flower market and calculate the environmental impact of landing, watering, and trading with them. Do you see how any of these contributes to world hunger? If so, how? We would like you to prepare a CSR strategy that fits the company’s goals and benefits the stakeholders. Create a presentation about your suggestion and a CSR plan for Eternal Fleur. Generate an Infographic or a Sample Landing Page of the message plan for key stakeholders.
