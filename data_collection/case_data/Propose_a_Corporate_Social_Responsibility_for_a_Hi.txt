Title: Propose a Corporate Social Responsibility for a High Growth Preserved Flowers Boutique

Topics: Corporate Social Responsibility, Marketing, Research & Development

### Background and Objective:
Eternal Fleur
’s mission is simple. To create environmentally friendly, preserved floral arrangements for our customers to enjoy for four seasons or longer. Its brilliant team creates luxurious and long-lasting floral arrangements for your most memorable occasions. Their Four Season Roses and Flowers™ can last 365+ days or longer without any water or sunlight. Each arrangement is hand-crafted with one-of-a-kind packaging and responsibly sourced preserved flowers with Rainforest Alliance Certification.
Eternal Fleur is a proudly women-owned and operated business that recognizes consumer satisfaction as an earned relationship, as it inspires us to design and develop quality products. The company’s founders established Eternal Fleur intending to give back to the planet by instilling a broader awareness of environmental efficacy and financial responsibility. Its primary motivation has always been to spread useful knowledge and promote practical lifestyle changes that start anywhere from the home to the office.
We assume at Eternal Fleur that the floral industry contributes to world hunger and the misuse of land and resources. As we raise our seed round of funding, we would like to lead with research around the impact farming flowers has on the environment. Eternal Fleur needs your help building a better understanding of the floral industry on the environment. They also need help converting these insights into a creative corporate social responsibility plan, including the communication strategy through their marketing materials and website.
PS:
Wondering how do these exquisite flowers last so long? Well, it’s glycerin, a natural ingredient often found in a bar of soap, which preserves the DNA of the product structure. Essentially, the less you touch your flowers, the longer they’ll live!

### Key Action Items:
After understanding the company’s vision, mission, and value proposition, we want you to dive deeper into the flower market and calculate the environmental impact of landing, watering, and trading with them. Do you see how any of these contributes to world hunger? If so, how? We would like you to prepare a CSR strategy that fits the company’s goals and benefits the stakeholders. Create a presentation about your suggestion and a CSR plan for Eternal Fleur. Generate an Infographic or a Sample Landing Page of the message plan for key stakeholders.
