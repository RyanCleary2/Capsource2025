    # Improved prompt: infer appropriate duration and session frequency from the goal (default 6 weeks, weekly)

      Mentorship Plan Goal: "#{goal_statement}"

      Context and requirements:
      - Infer an appropriate mentorship duration and session frequency from the goal. If unsure, default to a 6 meeting program, no more than 8 meetings.
      - Provide a clear Pre-Meeting Assignment that sets expectations, defines short-term and long-term goals, and includes preparatory work for the mentee.
      - Divide the plan into meetings. For each meeting provide tailored conversation starters / guiding questions, a suggested deliverable, this may include getting exposure for upcoming meetings or applying what was discussed previously.
      - Use an amount of conversation starters/questions that seems appropriate for each meeting and across the plan â€” do not exceed a total of 6 questions each meeting.
      - Ensure the mentor can leverage domain expertise to guide tasks. Pre-meeting assignments should be brief, experiential, thought-provoking, and produce artifacts that demonstrate progress.
      - After each meeting, suggest a deliverable that captures key takeaways and evidence of learning (e.g., an updated resume, a LinkedIn message, a mock interview recording, a one-page reflection).
      - Avoid generic advice. Personalize suggestions to common career-development, skill, or personal growth contexts (internships, career transitions, experiences).
      - Format the response with headings: Plan Title (short), Pre-Meeting Assignment, Meeting 1..N, Questions, Deliverable), a short Summary, and resource links if applicable.
      - Keep the Pre-Meeting Assignment should be an interesting learning experience that is concise and asynchronous-friendly.
